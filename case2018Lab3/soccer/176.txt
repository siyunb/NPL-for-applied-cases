 Joy of 2017 and hope of 2018," declared Al-Watan's headline banner above an image of Salah wearing a red-and-black Egypt shirt, arms raised in triumph, and sporting just a hint of a smile. The picture nearly took up the entire front page.
Salah, the newly crowned African Player of the Year, hasn't sent Egyptians streaming to street cafes to watch him play just because of his phenomenal club form. He also led Egypt's national team to this year's World Cup finals in Russia, the first time in nearly 30 years.
At those packed street cafes, TV channels showing Lionel Messi's Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid－for years the subjects of obsession for Egyptian fans－are now flicked over for Liverpool and Salah's latest showing.
Intriguingly, Salah's soccer success is prompting a deeper examination of what's happening in Egypt.
In 2011, Egyptians rose up during the Arab Spring to remove the unpopular Hosni Mubarak as president after 29 years in charge. But the country was then subject to instability and violence, first under direct military control and then under Islamist leader Mohamed Morsi. It's now ruled by army general-turned-president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
Right now, it's not just soccer fans hailing Salah's success.
"This is linked to the notion by tyrannical or authoritarian regimes of creating a distraction from the basic issues that people should be concerned with," said Amar Ali Hassan, an Egyptian novelist and social-science researcher.
