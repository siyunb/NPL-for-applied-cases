 "It's one thing to punish someone individually and a second thing to punish everybody.
"If I think he can help the team win; that's nothing to do with the fact he can be punished separately, individually." Wenger, who said Jack Wilshere will miss Sunday's game at Bournemouth after sustaining an ankle injury, watched from the press box while serving the second game of his three-match touchline ban.
He said the experience of being surrounded by reporters had been strange.
"It was frustrating but you (the media) have the best seats," said the Frenchman.
"The position was quite interesting, because I was close to the bench and not too high up. I like that."
