MILANÔºçAn Italian court sentenced former AC Milan and Brazil forward Robinho in absentia to nine years in prison on Thursday after convicting him of taking part in a gang rape of an Albanian woman in 2013.
A Milan court ruled that Robinho and five other Brazilians assaulted the woman, who was 22 at the time, after plying her with alcohol in a nightclub. The whereabouts of Robinho's five companions is not known, so their trial has been put on hold.
Robinho, 33, who currently plays with Atletico Mineiro in Brazil, pleaded not guilty via his lawyer and never appeared at any of the court hearings in northern Italy.
"We would like to clarify that he has already defended himself against the accusations, affirming that he did not participate in the episode," said a statement posted on Robinho's Instagram feed. "All legal measures are being taken."
The former Manchester City and Guangzhou Evergrande forward has a right to two appeals and Italy would only seek extradition if that legal process was exhausted, a legal source said.
However, Brazil does not allow for the extradition of its own citizens, meaning he would only risk arrest and deportation if he was stopped in another country.
The Milan court ordered the victim receive 60,000 euros ($71,000) in compensation for her ordeal.
Robinho has won 100 caps for Brazil, scoring 28 goals.
He began his career at Santos, winning the league in 2002 and 2004, before being snapped up Real Madrid in 2005. He spent three years at the Spanish giant before bouncing between clubs in England, Italy, China and Brazil over the next decade.
