Ronaldo scored once in regulation and twice in extra time, while Marco Asensio also netted late for Madrid, which advanced 6-3 on aggregate after a 2-1 first leg win in Germany.
"In the big moments, Ronaldo always comes through," Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. "He scored five times in these two games, what else can I say?"Ronaldo had scored both goals for Madrid in the first leg, when he became the first player to reach 100 goals in European club competition.
Bayern played a man down from the 84th minute after Arturo Vidal picked up his second yellow card of the night for a foul on Asensio.
