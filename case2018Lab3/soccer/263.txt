 "Probably, yes."
Guardiola was more circumspect, instead opting to congratulate his players on becoming the first team in the history of the English top flight to win 14 straight games within the same season.
"You cannot be champions in December," he said.
"It's important for our confidence to feel that we can compete on big stages with huge personality. Of course we are so happy. But it's December.
"We have three days (before playing Swansea City), no recovery. In (another) three days, Tottenham Hotspur. We'll see where we are in March and April.
"But of course we're so glad and so happy to win 14 games in a row."
