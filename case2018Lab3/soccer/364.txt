 
STOCKHOLM - Zlatan Ibrahimovic's unbroken 10-year run as Sweden's best player came to an end on Monday when FC Krasnodar defender Andreas Granqvist won the country's Golden Ball for 2017. 
Ibrahimovic, who retired from international soccer after a disappointing Swedish showing at Euro 2016, dominated the award from 2007-16 and took it 11 times overall. 
No other player has won it more than twice. 
 
 

Granqvist, Ibrahimovic's successor as captain, last week led Sweden to a 1-0 aggregate playoff victory over Italy to reach next year's World Cup finals in Russia. 
Ibrahimovic, Sweden's 36-year-old all-time leading scorer, returned from a serious knee injury for Manchester United against Newcastle United last week. 
He wasn't left completely empty-handed at the Fotbollsgalan awards, being named the nation's top attacker for his club performances. 
The Diamond Ball for best female player went to Linkoping FC midfielder Kosovare Asllani, who returned home this season after five years abroad with Paris Saint Germain and Manchester City.
