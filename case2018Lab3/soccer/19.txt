NANNING - Gareth Bale scored a hat-trick to help Wales crush hosts China 6-0 in the opener of the 2018 China Cup International Football Championship and secure the first win for Ryan Giggs as the coach of Wales here Thursday night.
Both teams fielded their best players available for the game, but Wales were apparently the stronger side which put huge pressure on the hosts from the kick-off.
Bale, who spent 30 hours on the trip to China, scored the first goal for his team in the third minute, before he made it 2-0 in the 21st minute.
Sam Vokes extended the lead to 3-0 in the 37th minute as he tipped the ball into the net through the pass from Andy King. Harry Wilson scored another goal before half time to make it 4-0.
Wales kept the momentum after the interval as Vokes beat the keeper in a one-on-one situation and made it 5-0 in the 57th minute. Bale soon completed his hat-trick to make it 6-0 before he was substituted by Ben Woodburn in the 63rd minute.
China was very close to a consolation goal but Yu Hanchao's shot after cutting in the penalty area from left wing was denied by the post.
Wales hence go into the final and China have to face the third-place playoff.
In the first edition of the tournament last year, China lost 2-0 to Iceland but finished third after beating Croatia in a penalty shootout.
