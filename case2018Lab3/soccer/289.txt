MEDELLIN - Spaniard Juan Manuel Lillo has resigned as coach of Atletico Nacional, the Colombian club said on Tuesday.
The announcement followed Nacional's loss to Deportes Tolima on penalties last week, a result that eliminated the Medellin club from the first division finalizacion tournament.
"Lillo arrived at the club with exceptional credentials and after his time working with the team [we] ratify his quality as a person and as a coach," Nacional said in a statement on their official website.
Lillo, 54, joined Nacional in June, replacing Reinaldo Rueda.
His 36-year coaching career has included spells in charge of Real Sociedad, Zaragoza, Salamanca, Oviedo and Tenerife in Spain's top flight.
