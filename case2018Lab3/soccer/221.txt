Mourinho's men hoping to take out their frustrations on Burnley
MANCHESTER, England - Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata admitted his teammates are furious after dropping two points at Leicester City, but he hopes they can channel that frustration into a strong response against Burnley on Tuesday.
Jose Mourinho's side was stunned by a late goal from 10-man Leicester in a 2-2 draw that saw United fall 13 points behind leader Manchester City at the halfway stage of the campaign.
Mourinho angrily spoke of missing "joke chances" and "childish" errors from his players after Saturday's draw.
But Mata, who scored both United goals in an excellent personal display, hopes his side responds positively to the frustrating evening at King Power Stadium.
"You have to keep going. It's Christmas time, you play every two or three days obviously," Mata said. "Now we feel frustrated and angry but we need to keep going and, from tomorrow, rest and think about the next game and have the will of finishing the next game with a much better feeling.
"We got a point but it feels like a defeat because we were so close to winning, had chances to kill the game and they were with one less player."
Mata put United 2-1 ahead with a superbly taken freekick and revealed afterwards that his goal celebration was a dedication to Indian children with whom his charitable foundation Common Goal works.
"It was because when the kids from the Oscar Foundation - one of the foundations we work with - came to Old Trafford to visit me they asked if I could do this kind of namaste (a respectful greeting) celebration for them," explained Mata.
"The first goal I didn't do it because we needed a second goal but for the second goal I thought of them and it was dedicated for those kids in the slums of Mumbai."
