Lack of players in world's top leagues a concern for game here
The alarming dearth of Chinese players in the world's major soccer leagues is a worrying sign for the state of game's health here.
These days, Zhang Yuning is the sole Chinese representative in Europe's elite divisions, but the 21-year-old hasn't had much to cheer of late.
Zhang began his overseas career in the Netherlands with Vitesse, signing a two-year contract with the Arnhem-based Eredivisie club.
Mainly playing as a back-up striker, he caught the eye of West Bromwich Albion and moved to the Premier League club in July last year on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
The Baggies immediately loaned Zhang out to Werder Bremen for two years to gain first-team experience but it hasn't happened for the China international in Germany and it is rumored a return home is on the cards.
Not so long ago, Chinese fans could follow the exploits of Sun Jihai, Yang Chen and Zheng Zhi, who all made their mark in the top tiers of England, Germany and Scotland, respectively.
Defender Sun was a fan favorite at Manchester City during the 2000s, and thrilled supporters back home by becoming the first Chinese player to score in the English Premier League, as well as the UEFA Cup.
