Former Bayer Leverkusen and Roma center back Juan has signed a new one-year contract with Brazilian club Flamengo, extending his professional career to the 23rd season.
"Everybody knows that I have always dreamed of finishing my career at the club where I took my first steps as a footballer and a man," he said on Instagram.
"I will continue to play as long as I feel that I can help Flamengo to win titles. I believe that I'm still able to play at a high level."
Juan, who will turn 39 in February, began his career at Flamengo in 1996 before signing with Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 and then Roma in 2007.
He joined Brazil's Internacional in 2012 and returned to Flamengo in 2015.
The defender was capped 79 times for Brazil's national team and played in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.
