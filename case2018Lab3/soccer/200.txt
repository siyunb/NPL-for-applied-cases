LONDON - Manchester City's 18-match winning streak was ended by Premier League strugglers Crystal Palace as the South London club held the leaders to a 0-0 draw at home on Sunday.
But Pep Guardiola's side managed to keep unbeaten this season after 21 matches with 19 wins and two draws. They are 14 points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who defeated Stoke City 5-0 on Saturday.
Palace midfielder Luka Milivojevic had the chance to inflict on City their first defeat of the campaign after Raheem Sterling fouled Wilfried Zaha on the stoppage time, but his penalty down the middle was stopped by Ederson's legs.
Ederson also saved Patrick van Aanholt's deflected shot in the first half before Eagles defender Scott Dann and City forward Gabriel Jesus were forced off injured.
Palace, whose midfielder Jason Puncheon was also injured, are 17th, one point above the relegation zone.
"I am not thinking to be unbeaten," said Guardiola. "That is not going to happen...There are now more strong teams, a lot of competitions, a lot of games."
Arsenal were held to a 1-1 draw by West Brom at The Hawthorns as Jay Rodriguez fired a spot-kick past Petr Cech to earn the struggling hosts a point.
Alexis Sanchez had scored 83rd-minute free-kick to give Arsenal a 1-0 lead.
