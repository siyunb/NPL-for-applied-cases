French newspaper Le Parisien had earlier reported that tests on Monday morning had ruled out a "fracture or a serious sprain".

Despite the injury potentially benefiting Madrid, the Spanish side's coach Zinedine Zidane said he hoped Neymar would recover in time to play.

PSG has never managed to reach the Champions League final. It lost at the last-16 stage last season after a humiliating 6-1 second-leg thrashing by a Neymar-inspired Barcelona, after winning the first game 4-0.
