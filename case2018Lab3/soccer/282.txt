 Arsenal in 2006 and Manchester United in 2008. The furthest Spurs have previously reached was the quarterfinals in 2011.
But despite winning its group, thanks to a victory and draw against Real Madrid, Tottenham could still face a tough team when the competition resumes in February.
Bayern Munich and Juventus are among the second-place teams who could await the English club in the draw on Monday.
APOEL exited Europe after finishing last in the group. Borussia Dortmund qualified for the Europa League despite losing 3-2 to second-place Madrid.
