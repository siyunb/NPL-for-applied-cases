 "Let's be together to support our players, to support the club and all give our absolute best to be at the level that we want to be." 
Arsenal's Wembley win against the Blues gave the Gunners a third FA Cup in four seasons and made Wenger the first manager in history to win it seven times. 
However, it is 13 years since the last of his three Premier League title triumphs, while his seven straight last-16 exits in the Champions League is damning of Arsenal's shortcomings in Europe. 
Wenger's key objectives for the offseason will be to tie star duo Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil to new contracts and strengthen his squad for its Europa League campaign. 
On Wednesday he pledged Arsenal would only look to sign "top, top quality" players and said having a "very heavy squad" meant "we might lose some players". 
"We're committed to mounting a sustained league challenge and that will be our focus this summer and next season," he added. 
Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, an Arsenal shareholder who recently had a takeover bid rejected, warned that Wenger won't be successful unless he has the complete backing of the board. 
"What is now of paramount importance is that he receives the full support of the board and majority shareholder," Usmanov said. 
"He has a great opportunity to deliver the success that the fans deserve. However, without the right support there remains a real risk his legacy will be tarnished."
