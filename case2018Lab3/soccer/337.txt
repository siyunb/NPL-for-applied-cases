 we are in a crisis. We have to try everything to reap a win as soon as possible," Hoffenheim's coach Julian Nagelsmann said.
Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin increased Cologne's relegation worries as the "Old Lady" overpowered the "Billy Goats", who suffered the 11th loss of the season.
Vedad Ibisevic has large shares on the away victory after providing one goal in each half to secure all three points.
With the result, Berlin jumped on the 11th position whereas winless Cologne stay on the last place of the standings with an eleven-point gap to safety.
