BERLIN -- Schalke will travel to China for the second time, the "Royal Blues" announced in an official statement on Monday.
Schalke will spend their 2018 pre-season preparations in China for the second consecutive summer tour.
After touring in China last summer, the "Royal Blues" will return to one of the biggest growth markets of soccer from July 16-22.
"China is one of the most important target markets within our long term internationalization strategy. Our second visit in row gives us therefore the perfect opportunity to expand Schalke's reach internationally," marketing executive Alexander Jobst said.
Markus Weinzierl's men are set to encounter two European top-flight teams for friendlies on July 19 and 21. Further information regarding the venues and opponents will be announced soon.
Schalke sit currently on the 10th place of the table. They will clash with relegated Ingolstadt at the last round in Bundesliga on Saturday.
