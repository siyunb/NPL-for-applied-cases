RIO DE JANEIRO - Guangzhou Evergrande midfielder Ricardo Goulart could return to his native Brazil next year to play for Palmeiras, according to local media reports.
Goulart, who is currently on holiday in Sao Jose dos Campos, near Sao Paulo, is a transfer target of Palmeiras football director Alexandre Mattos, according to Brazil's TV Globo.
Mattos was in charge of the football department at Cruzeiro when Goulart played at the club in 2013 and 2014, and the pair have remained close since, according to the broadcaster.
Goulart, 26, has scored 78 goals in 123 matches for Evergrande since joining the club from Cruzeiro for 18 million euros in January 2015.
He is contracted to the Chinese Super League side until January 2020.
