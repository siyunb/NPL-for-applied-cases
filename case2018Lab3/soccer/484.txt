 "Greetings to the fans in China! I'm Neymar Jr, this is my official Weibo account. 
"I am going to be sharing my own personal experiences here with Chinese fans. 
"I'm looking forward to your following and reposting! See you in Shanghai on Monday!" 
The message was written in English and Chinese, but gave no further details on his movements in China. 
Barcelona teammates said last Friday they have begged Neymar to resist the temptation of moving to PSG. 
The French giant is supposedly ready to launch a record-breaking move for Neymar, sparking exit fears. 
"It's true, something did happen, but that's sometimes what happens in training," Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta said. 
"All the talk about Neymar right now, everything is magnified. Things like this can happen. It's a personal decision for him, but of course we want him to stay." 
Strike partner Luis Suarez has formed a deadly partnership with Neymar and echoed Iniesta's calls for the interest from PSG to be dismissed once and for all. 
"As soon as he clarifies the situation it's better for us and for him," said Suarez. 
"He will have his say when he is ready and as a teammate I will support him no matter what. Our relationship won't change. We want him to stay." 
Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde swerved the media on the eve of the match with archrival Real, but Iniesta sang Neymar's praises. 
"For me, he's one of the best players in the world. He brings so much to the team and hopefully he will stay for many years," Iniesta said. 
"He is worth more than $200 million or $300 million. His playing style suits us perfectly and he can only improve with us."
