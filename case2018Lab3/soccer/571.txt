 the club, the players, myself. I have to compliment everyone. From tomorrow we have to think about what we can do in these in 20 days. 
"It's right to be enthusiastic, but we'll take it one step at a time. We have to improve certain things, because this squad is capable of more." 
Monaco's young team has earned a lot of admirers this season and coach Leonardo Jardim's task will be to keep his players together, especially with many top clubs following Mbappe. 
The 18-year-old striker wasn't even born when 39-year-old Juve goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made his Serie A debut in 1995. 
"We leave here eliminated, but still with our heads held high," Mbappe said. "My goal against Buffon didn't help anything, it's pretty much just anecdotal." 
As for Monaco's performances in this season's Champions League, Mbappe saw them as valuable experience. 
"We don't have many regrets about this campaign," he said. "Mixing with the top teams is what's best for progression. Today we learned a lot, I learnt a lot and we'll try to come back next season better armed."
