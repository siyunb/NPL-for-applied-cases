BUENOS AIRES - Argentina and Catalonia could meet in a friendly before next year's World Cup, the president of the Argentine Football Association (AFA) said on Monday.
The match would occur at the Camp Nou in Barcelona on June 4, just days before Argentina's scheduled arrival in Russia for football's showpiece tournament, according to AFA head Claudio Tapia.
He told Argentina' s Radio Rivadavia that AFA officials would meet with representatives of a Spanish marketing company in Buenos Aires on Tuesday to discuss details of the proposal.
"Tomorrow they will come and make an offer," Tapia said. "We are going to listen to them and see if we can play a match before travelling to Russia."
Argentina hold a 2-1 advantage in head-to-head encounters between the teams, all of which have been at the Camp Nou.
The Albiceleste will begin their 2018 World Cup campaign against Iceland in Group D on June 16.
