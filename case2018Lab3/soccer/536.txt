 
CARDIFF, Wales - Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon magnanimously conceded Real Madrid's superior ability had made the difference after his side crashed to a 4-1 defeat in Saturday's Champions League final in Cardiff. 
"We are disappointed," goalkeeper Buffon told the website of European governing body UEFA. 
"We played very well in the first half. We thought we had enough to win the game. I cannot explain why we played like we did in the second half. 
"Real Madrid deserved to win in the second half. They showed their class and the attitude needed to play in this kind of game." 
Ronaldo's 20th-minute opener was canceled out by a stupendous Mario Mandzukic goal. The Croatian chested down Gonzalo Higuain's volleyed layoff and arced a sublime volley over Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas. 
But Casemiro restored Madrid's lead just beyond the hour. 
 
 

Further strikes from Ronaldo and substitute Marco Asensio sealed victory for Zinedine Zidane's side, the European champion in three of the last four seasons. 
"In the first half we played beautifully. In the second half we were too static," beaten manager Massimiliano Allegri told his post-match media conference. 
"We managed to defend for 15 minutes. As you know, football can be a nightmare. 
"(Miralem) Pjanic's shot was deflected wide, Casemiro's shot was deflected into the goal."
