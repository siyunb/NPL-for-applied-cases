One day before the important match, to be played Tuesday evening at the 32,000 capacity Philip II stadium in Skopje, the head coaches Zinedin Zidane of Real Madrid and Jose Mourinho of Machester United said at a press conference that they both had high expectations for the match.
Zidane told reporters that Real Madrid was ready to win this match while he also confirmed that star Christiano Ronaldo was ready to face Manchester United in the European Super Cup.
He also dismissed claims that Ronaldo would stay off the field due to an injury.
According to Zidane, Ronaldo is as sharp as two months ago when he scored twice for Real Madrid in the Champions League final.
"We have prepared well for the first official game of the new season. We are well rested and eager physically," Zidane said.
On the other hand, Manchester United coach Mourinho seemed eager ahead of the match.
Heading to Skopje with a fully fit squad, Mourinho told reporters at a press conference that his team would play to beat Real Madrid.
"We are going to try but the difference between the Champions League winners and Europa League winners is obvious. The Europa Leage...is very difficult to win but we believe it is possible," Mourinho said.
He also expressed his interest in Real Madrid player Gareth Bale, saying that he would make an offer for his services.
