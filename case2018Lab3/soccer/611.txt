 "A lot of strength â€” we are with you." And Dortmund didn't let the Spaniard down on the field despite losing the first leg, which was originally due to be played on Tuesday.
"It was very difficult for the team to focus on the game," Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said. "But we noticed that training did us good."Far from capitulating against one of Europe's high-scoring sides, for whom Kylian Mbappe scored twice, Dortmund fought back to deny Monaco a commanding lead to take into the second leg.
"Of course it affected everyone on our team," Dortmund winger Christian Pulisic told British broadcaster BT, sidestepping questions about whether the game should have gone ahead so soon after a traumatic incident.
"Today was the day that the game was and we had to play it. So we tried to go out and I'm still proud of us for being strong and going out and playing regardless."There was an early reprieve for the hosts when Fabinho missed a penalty after Mbappe was held back. And it was a fortuitous opener from Mbappe in the 19th minute, with Thomas Lemar's cross deflecting off his knee and going into the net.
But Lars Bender, the midfielder who replaced Bartra in the starting lineup and deployed as a makeshift defender, was left red-faced when he headed Andrea Raggi's cross into his own net in the 35th minute for 2-0 to Monaco.
