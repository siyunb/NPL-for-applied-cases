RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil's Gremio have signed Peru under-18 captain Marco Saravia on a 12-month loan as they bolster their squad for the 2019 season.
The center-back joins the Porto Alegre outfit from Peruvian first division side Deportivo Municipal, officials from both clubs said on Saturday.
"Deportivo Municipal wishes the defender, Marco Saravia, all the best in this new phase with Gremio," the Lima club said on Twitter.
Saravia, 17, was promoted from Deportivo's youth academy earlier this year and made two appearances for the first team in Peru's Primera Division in 2017.
Gremio are currently competing in the FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, having qualified for the tournament by defeating Argentina's Lanus in the final of the Copa Libertadores last month.
