 after a goal, penalty decisions, after a straight red card or in cases of mistaken identity.
Two of the top complaints have involved VAR either being used too often and slowing down the game or-conversely - not being called on in decisive moments.
One case in England - where VAR has been trialed in the FA Cup - saw the referee given a different picture from the one shown to confused fans on television.
Some head coaches said Russia will be something of a test case about which it was premature to pass judgement.
"It's something to improve football, we suppose," said Uruguay's assistant coach Celso Otero.
"I think VAR will be approved and then we will evaluate it."
Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr said FIFA's refereeing department chief Massimo Busacca assured skeptics at Wednesday's meeting that video replays produced fairer outcomes. According to Rohr, Busacca said "it was very important for the referee to make less mistakes to have the video assistant".
"VAR is coming to eliminate mistakes by the referee. It's actually something that makes the game fair," Saudi Arabia's assistant coach Manuel Suarez agreed.
England's national team in particular has had famous run-ins with disputed goals at the World Cup.
Diego Maradona's "Hand of God" saw eventual winner Argentina through to the World Cup semifinals in 1986 while Germans are still smarting about a goal that helped England win its only World Cup in 1966.
Some coaches agreed that resorting to replays could result in match interruptions that break up a team's rhythm and momentum.
"It might slow down a little bit the play," said Egypt assistant coach Jose Fantaguzzi.
"But, in general, the technology is very important for the time being."
Yet Fantaguzzi also admitted his squad is a tad anxious about how it will all turn out.
"A little bit, but not that much," Fantaguzzi said with a laugh. "We are just ready to follow the rules and prepare."
