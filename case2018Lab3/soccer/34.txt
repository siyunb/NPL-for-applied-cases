 "Soccer is still a relatively new sport in China that many people aren't familiar with. As such, starting an academy for youth is an ideal way to go about promoting the sport."
Star Coaching is currently cooperating with Dulwich College, Shanghai Jincai International School and Freesoul Kindergarten to conduct training sessions. Spencer said that the company is looking to enter partnerships with another three international schools in the near future. Plans to work with local schools are also in the pipeline.
Spencer is optimistic about his business prospects and the future of the sport in China.
"Chinese parents are the most focused parents in the world and they are paying a lot of attention to the development of their kids. Most of them have a very positive attitude toward football and see it as a means to help their kids grow," he said.
"We plan to have more than 1,000 children join our training sessions. The long-term plan for Star Coaching is of course to influence more Chinese youth to pick up soccer as a sport."
