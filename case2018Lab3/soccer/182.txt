 "It feels great to be an Everton player. I'm really happy to be here and happy that everything is done. I'm really excited to play for Everton as soon as possible. Everton is a great club with a big history and a big culture and I'm looking forward to showing the fans the kind of player I am."
Allardyce described the signing, his first as Everton manager, as a massive boost for the club.
"He is Turkey's number one striker and has scored goals in the Champions League and the Turkish League. I don't think you can look any more than we have done and, for the price, this is the best in Europe at the moment," said the manager.
