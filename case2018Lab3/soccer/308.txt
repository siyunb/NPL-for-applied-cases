Spain coach Julen Lopetegui remained cautious after seeing the group that Spain were handed in the draw for next summer's World Cup, held in Moscow on Friday afternoon.
Spain were drawn to face reigning European champions Portugal, Morocco and Iran in Group B and should be favorites to reach the last 16, although their coach, who led them to Russia without suffering defeat in their qualifying matches, showed respect to the sides his team will face next summer.
"It is a complicated, difficult and hard group, but it couldn't be any other way in a World Cup," he said to the Spanish media after the draw.
"Portugal are a great team, who have beaten us not long ago, while Morocco qualified by beating the Ivory Coast and are a very well consolidated side, while Iran didn't conceded any goals and they are going to ask a lot of us," said Lopetegui.
He then looked at each the three sides in greater depth, highlighting Portugal are; "a great side. They are the current European champions and have a group of players of the highest level," said the Spain coach.
Lopetegui highlighted that Morocco, "have very interesting players and the majority of them play in Europe, also they have not lost any games," while explaining that Iran coach Carlos Queiroz "has been with them for a long time (7 years by next summer) and they were the first team to qualify for the World Cup."
