 
 PARIS - Neymar and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain's deadly double act, again delivered a goal apiece in a sluggish 2-0 victory over Troyes that took it 10 points clear of its Ligue 1 challengers on Wednesday. 
 While its nearest chaser, Lyon, succumbed 2-1 at home to struggling Lille and Monaco fell 1-0 at Nantes after a lastgasp Lucas Lima thunderbolt, PSG marched on without ever hitting top gear. 
 A brilliant Neymar strike in the 73rd minute, his 15th goal in all competitions this term, eased nerves at Parc des Princes before the Brazilian set up Cavani, who had a first-half penalty saved, to score in stoppage time. 
 For the second time this season, the pair had a spirited debate over who should take the penalty. 
 Cavani won the argument, only to be turned aside by goalkeeper Mamadou Samassa, who dived to his right. 
 Neymar and Cavani then worked in perfect harmony for the Uruguayan's 23rd goal, stretching his lead as top marksman in Europe's major leagues this season. 
 The losses for Lyon and Monaco enabled Marseille, with its emphatic 3-0 win at bottom club Metz, to move into second place but it is 10 points adrift of unbeaten PSG, who moved on to 41 points. 
 Third-place Lyon and Monaco, both with 29 points, are two points behind Marseille. PSG seemed out of sorts against an opponent it hammered 9-0 in their last meeting when sealing the title in 2016, but looked to be in charge once Cavani earned the penalty with a theatrical fall under Karim Azamoum's shirt tug. 
 Just as in a game against Lyon in September when the pair bickered over who should take a spot-kick, Cavani won the day but saw his 40th-minute effort saved, this time by Mamadou Samassa, who was way off his line as the ball was struck. 
 Neymar never stopped trying to galvanize his team, and the former Barcelona star took his one chance superbly, marauding to the edge of the box before unleashing a left-foot shot.
