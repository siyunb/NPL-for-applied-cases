"And I live two minutes from the club's home, so I don't have to worry about traffic. Because I live so close to the stadium, I don't even need a car. I'm in a new phase in my life and it's making me a better person. I'm growing on and off the field." 
As for the quality of the Chinese Super League, Augusto said it now deserved to be ranked among the strongest club competitions in the world - an evaluation in stark contrast to Shanghai Shenhua striker Carlos Tevez's recent summation that Chinese players are technically and tactically below par. 
The CSL has attracted established global stars like Oscar, Tevez, Hulk and Ramires, and Augusto is also impressed by the strides made in upgrading facilities. 
"When I arrived, they (Beijing Guo'an officials) called me and asked me what I needed at the club and how I thought it could improve," he added. 
"I gave them a list of recommendations and they started making changes. They improved the locker room, the gym. 
"The club has grown a lot since I first came here. Chinese football is developing quickly. More and more top players are coming."
