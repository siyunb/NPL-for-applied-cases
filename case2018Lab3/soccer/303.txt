 "We got lucky with the draw. We should be able to handle all those teams." 
 Russia will launch its campaign to win Group A against Saudi Arabia in Moscow's historic Luzhniki Stadium in the tournament's opening match on June 14. 
 Russia has not advanced beyond the first round in three World Cup appearances since 1991. 
 The pressure is on coach Stanislav Cherchesov - the former Spartak Moscow goalkeeper - to repeat Russia's dream run at Euro 2008. 
 The flamboyant team from nearly a decade ago stunned the Netherlands 3-1 in the quarterfinals before being beaten 3-0 by eventual champion Spain that year. 
 Cherchesov appeared to be trying to play it coy by saying he did not know much about the teams in his group. 
 "I cannot say whether I'm happy or not," he told reporters. "I'm not familiar with any of our group's teams. 
 "We just didn't want to get Spain from pot two."
