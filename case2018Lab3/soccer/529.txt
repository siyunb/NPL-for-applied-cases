TEHRAN - Iran became the second team to qualify for the 2018 World Cup after beating Uzbekistan 2-0 here on Monday. 
It will be Iran's fifth appearance at soccer's premier tournament. 
Sardar Azmoun scored in the 23rd minute and Mehdi Taremi added in the 88th at Azadi Stadium in Tehran. 
The win means Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz's team will finish in the top two places in Group A of Asia's final round of qualifying. Uzbekistan is eight points behind the leader in third place and has only two games remaining. 
The top two teams in each of Asia's two qualifying groups advance automatically to the finals while the teams in third place go through a series of playoffs. 
South Korea is in second place in Group A, a point ahead of Uzbekistan with a game in hand. 
Brazil was the first team to qualify for next year's World Cup in Russia.
