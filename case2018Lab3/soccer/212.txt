LONDON - Liverpool confirmed Wednesday an agreement had been reached to sign Dutch international Virgil van Dijk.
Liverpool said they had agreed a deal with both Southampton FC and the player that will see the 26-year-old defender move to Anfield when the transfer window re-opens on New Year's Day. Van Dijk will be assigned squad number four upon his arrival at Liverpool, the club said on its official website.
The player has cost Liverpool 75 million pounds (100.50 million US dollars), a new world record fee for a defender.
Media reports said Liverpool beat Manchester City and Chelsea who had both shown an interest in van Dijk.
The deal followed several days of what the Daily Telegraph described as discreet negotiations between the two clubs over the past few days.
Liverpool had expressed an interest in the player last summer and were ready to offer 60 million pounds (80.40 million US dollars). The newspaper sports writer said van Dijk would be paid a weekly salary of 180,000 pounds (242,000 US dollars).
In a statement van Dijk said he was "delighted and honored" to sign for Liverpool, accepted he had had a "difficult last few months" at Southampton. He was left out of Southampton's team for their 5-2 Premier League defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in their Boxing Day clash. His absence from the squad fuelled speculation the defender was about to leave the south coast club and head north to Liverpool.
Liverpool are currently fourth in the league table, while Southampton on 14th.
