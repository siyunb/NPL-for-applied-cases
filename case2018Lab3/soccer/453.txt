BELGRADE - Serbian Red Star on Thursday beat Russian club Krasnodar 2-1 in the second game of the playoffs of the Europa League qualification stage and qualified for the group phase of the UEFA Europa league.
Having lost the first match with 3-2, Red Star set the score even in the second match to 4-4, and qualified to the group phase because it scored more away goals.
In front of 50,000 football fans in Belgrade, Red Star opened the lead with the goal of Nemanja Radonjic in the 7th minute, and Guelor Kanga expanded it at 46th of the match with a spectacular lob.
Although the Russian team desperately attacked, and narrowed the gap to 2-1 through Andreas Granqvist at the 82nd minute of the match, it was still not enough for the visiting team.
This is the first time after ten years that Red Star qualifies for the group phase of the Europa League. Red Star is the second team from Serbia to qualify for the group stage, as the country's champion Partizan today also beat Videoton in Hungary by 4-0.
Group phase draw will take place on Friday in Monaco.
