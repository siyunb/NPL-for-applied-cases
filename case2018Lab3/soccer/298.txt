Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri said the brilliance of Higuain, who left for Turin in 2016, was key for the champion. 
"Higuain is a phenomenon in these situations. Juventus have 90 million euro less in the bank, but an extra three points," said Sarri. 
"I know Juventus are not loved in Naples, but while Gonzalo was with us, he behaved impeccably." 
Arkadiusz Milik's absence is beginning to hurt Napoli. The Polish striker's knee ligament injury means Dries Mertens remains the southern club's only centerforward.

Napoli travels to Dutch side Feyenoord this week looking to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League.
