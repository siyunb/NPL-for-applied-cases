 "It's not important. It was important to score.
"But at the same time I think that we conceded the first goal in an unlucky way.
"It was a fair result, but in the end I think that we deserved a little more than Liverpool."
The result kept Chelsea in third place, but it now trails second-place Manchester United by three points and will fall 11 points behind City if Pep Guardiola's side prevails at Huddersfield.
Eden excels 
Although his influence faded, Hazard was Chelsea's stand-out performer, the Belgium international's every first-half touch oozing sophistication.
Having missed the start of the season after ankle surgery, Hazard has returned to top form in recent weeks, whether playing as a wide forward or, as at Anfield, supporting Alvaro Morata in a 3-5-2 system.
"The start of this season was full of trouble with Eden because he had an injury with the national team and then we started the season without him," Conte said.
"When you have this type of injury and you need surgery, it's very important to have the best time for your recovery.
"Now Eden is in really good form. He likes to play as a striker. There is a good link with Alvaro.
"For me it's also a great opportunity to have the possibility to play with two different systems.
"Against Qarabag (who Chelsea beat 4-0 in the Champions League) we played with a 3-4-2-1. Today we started with a 3-5-2. It's very important that we don't lose our identity in both cases."
