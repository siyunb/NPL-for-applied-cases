RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's Sao Paulo have confirmed that former Juventus midfielder Hernanes will return to Hebei China Fortune this month after a successful loan spell.
But the Tricolor have not given up hope of negotiating a new deal for the 32-year-old, who has expressed a desire to remain in Brazil.
"It's complicated but we think there is still a chance that we can reach a new agreement," Sao Paulo executive director Rai told reporters.
Hernanes rejoined his original club in July on a 12-month loan but the Chinese Super League outfit exercized an option to end the deal on December 31.
The playmaker made 19 appearances for Sao Paulo in 2017 and scored nine goals.
Hernanes said he has not given up hope of swift return to Brazil as he seeks an international recall ahead of the World Cup in June and July.
"I'm still going to try to find a way to stay [at Sao Paulo] by speaking to a director or the coach personally in China," Hernanes said. "If I stay I think I will be closer to the radar of the national team."
Hebei China Fortune signed Hernanes from Italy's Juventus on a three-year deal in January. His career has also included spells at Lazio and Internazionale.
