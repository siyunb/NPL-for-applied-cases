MADRID -- Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema both got back among the goals when Real Madrid won 3-2 at home to Malaga.
Malaga, who had not scored a goal away from home before arriving in Madrid, were unlucky not to take a point after they had a goal harshly ruled out for pushing on the stroke of halftime.
Benzema opened the scoring after Ronaldo had hit the bar only for Diego Rolan to quickly equalize.
Casemiro headed Madrid back in front, but in the second half, Chori Castro again pegged Madrid back with a long-range shot.
However, Ronaldo sealed the win after Luka Modric had been fouled in the Malaga penalty area, scoring the rebound after Roberto had saved his original spot kick.
Atletico Madrid also won with a crushing 5-0 triumph away to Levante, who made their task a lot easier when Rober scored a fifth minute own goal.
Kevin Gameiro scored two goals to put Atletico 3-0 ahead before Antoine Griezmann quietened some critics by netting Atletico's fourth and fifth of the game in a ground where they had not won in their last 7 attempts.
There was a dramatic finish to Betis' 2-2 draw at home to Girona with goals in the 94th and 95th minutes. The game looked to be heading for a 1-1 draw after Andres Guardado's 85th free kick cancelled out Portu's 46th minute opener, but Portu put Girona back in front in the 4th minute of injury time only for Cristian Tello to make it 2-2 with the last kick of the match.
The day kicked off with Eibar claiming a vital and deserved 2-1 win away to Alaves in a Basque derby.
Joan Jordan opened the scoring for Eibar in the 33rd minute, before Charles doubled their lead with just over 20 minutes remaining and although Burghi scored a late consolation it was not enough for Alaves, who also had striker Christian Santos sent off along with Eibar's Charles.
