RIO DE JANEIRO - Vasco da Gama's hopes of securing a berth in next year's Copa Libertadores were boosted by a 1-0 away victory over Cruzeiro in Brazil's Serie A championship on Sunday.
Defender Paulao struck the winner in the first half when he headed in after a Nene corner kick.
The result at the Mineirao stadium left Vasco seventh in the 20-team standings, behind sixth-placed Flamengo on goal difference with one round remaining.
The top six teams at the end of the season will earn a berth in next year's Copa Libertadores, South America's top club competition.
In Rio de Janeiro, Flamengo missed a chance to consolidate their place in the top six by losing 2-1 at home to Santos. Lucas Paqueta put the hosts ahead but Bruno Henrique and Arthur Gomez hit the target to lift Santos to third in the standings.
In other matches on Sunday, Avai won 1-0 at home to Atletico Paranaense, Atletico Mineiro drew 2-2 at Corinthians, Sao Paulo won 2-1 at Coritiba, Gremio were held to a 1-1 home draw by Atletico Goianiense, Vitoria won 3-2 at Ponte Preta and Chapecoense won 1-0 at Bahia.
