MADRID - Reigning King's Cup holders FC Barcelona took a small step towards the defense of their title when they drew 1-1 away to Celta Vigo in the first leg of their last 16 round tie on Thursday.
Barca coach Ernesto Valverde will have been pleased by the performance of B-team striker Jose Arnaiz, who scored Barca's goal in the 15th minute of the game.
Pione Sisto equalized for Celta before halftime, but Barca could have won the game had Sergio Busquets' long range shot not rebounded off the Celta crossbar.
Valverde, who rested Leo Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta, will nevertheless be content with the return of Ousmane Dembele who sustained a calf injury three months ago, but came on as a 72nd minute substitute.
Gareth Bale scored a penalty as Real Madrid won 3-0 away to second division side Numancia, who ended the game with 10 men after defender Pape Diamanka was sent off for a bad challenge on Nacho Fernandez with half an hour remaining in the game.
Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane gave time to players such as Marcos Llorente, Theo Hernandez and Dani Ceballos, but it wasn't until Isco scored a second penalty in the last minute of the game that the result was secure and Borja Mayoral's injury time header assured the return leg will be little more than a formality.
Elsewhere Leganes beat Villarreal 1-0 thanks to a 49th minute goal from Nordin Amrabat, while Levante came back after conceding a goal to Gerard Moreno to defeat Espanyol 2-1 thanks to goals from Jose Morales and Ivi.
