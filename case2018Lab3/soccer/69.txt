Suspected heart attack claims popular Italian international at 31
ROME - A visibly shaken Antonio Conte and World Cup winner Gianluigi Buffon paid emotional tributes to Davide Astori, who died at the age of 31 on Sunday, describing their Italian compatriot as "fantastic" and "a great guy".
Fiorentina and Italy international defender Astori was found dead from a suspected heart attack in his hotel room in Udine, where his team was staying ahead of Sunday's schedule Serie A match with Udinese.
Astori leaves behind a wife and a two-year-old daughter.
Conte, who coached the defender when he was in charge of the Italian national team, said the player's death was a "tragedy".
"This is a tragedy and it really hurts me. It's very difficult at this moment to find the right words for the family," Chelsea coach Conte told Sky Sports ahead of his team's Premier League match at Manchester City on Sunday.
"I had him with the national team. He was a great player but especially a fantastic guy. I stay close to his wife, parents and daughter. He was only 31 and it's very difficult to explain this situation."
Veteran Buffon, the Juventus captain, called Astori "a great man".
"Farewell dear Asto", wrote Buffon in a post on Instagram, accompanied by a photo of the two players exchanging pennants before a game between their clubs.
Buffon said he did not usually make a habit of expressing his feelings about others.
"I want to make an exception to my rule because you have a young wife and others close to you who are suffering, but mostly because your little girl deserves to know that her dad was a good man ... a great man."
