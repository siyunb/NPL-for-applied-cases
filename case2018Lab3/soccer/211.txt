 "Auba is a particular player. He is an extravagant and colorful character. That is something a city like Dortmund is benefitting from."
Zorc believes Stoeger is the right man to deal with Aubameyang's character because he managed to get along so well with Cologne rogue Anthony Modeste.
And if training remains an issue, Aubameyang is at least firing on match days, with Stoeger's tactical changes affording him more space up front.
The rest of the squad appear on board with the new approach too.
"The new tactics give us stability and confidence," midfielder Christian Pulisic stressed.
"The spirit of the team is improving, we are happy about the turnaround," Watzke said.
Now the focus for Dortmund, which is third in the Bundesliga and trails leader Bayern by 13 points, is qualifying for next season's Champions League.
Stoeger's management of Aubemayang will be key to their chances of achieving that.
