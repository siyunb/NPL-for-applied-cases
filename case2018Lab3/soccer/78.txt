 Injury woes 
After Neymar failed to prevent PSG from falling to a 3-1 loss in their Champions League last-16 first leg at Real Madrid, he injured himself late in Sunday's 3-0 win over Marseille and was stretchered off in anguish, before PSG confirmed he had sprained his right ankle and fractured a metatarsal.
The injury leaves his hopes of facing Real in the return match on March 6 all but over.
