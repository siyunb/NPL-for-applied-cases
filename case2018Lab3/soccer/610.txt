 "Most of the guys probably slept as little as I did. There is no golden way to deal with this because it was the first time for everyone."
Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim stressed the tie was far from over while acknowledging the match would largely be remembered for the incidents that occurred in the build-up.
"What will stay in history is not the result but what happened last night. It was difficult to prepare for this match.
"Last night, the players called their families and friends and their concentration was low. But on the pitch, both sides gave great performances," said the Portuguese.
"It's very significant to come and win here. But we're only halfway there."
