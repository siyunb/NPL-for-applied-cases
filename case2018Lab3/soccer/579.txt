Tottenham has worked in recent years to increase its footprint in China. The club opened the Jaguar Football Campus in Guangzhou in 2016 and has so far offered training to more than 100 coaches and 60,000 students.
Tottenham has a "Chinese social hub" on its official website that provides access to its pages on Weibo and WeChat, and has produced livestream events from the club's home stadium, White Hart Lane, on Chinese social media.
