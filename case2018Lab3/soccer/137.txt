BUENOS AIRES - Colombia international midfielder Juan Quintero has joined Argentine giants River Plate on a year-long loan from Porto.
The 25-year-old completed a medical in Buenos Aires on Tuesday and is expected to begin training with his new teammates this week.
"I'm very thankful for this opportunity," Quintero told reporters. "I have a lot of goals and playing at this club has a lot of merit. I want to make the most of it and learn. I think I'm ready for the challenge."
Quintero joins a distinguished list of Colombians to play for River Plate, including Radamel Falcao, Mario Yepes and Juan Pablo Angel.
He spent last season on loan at Independiente Medellin, scoring 16 goals in 36 matches across all competitions.
