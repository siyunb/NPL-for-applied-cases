NANNING, China -- Two days ahead of their match against Wales in the China Cup International Football Championship , Chinaâ€™s coach Marcello Lippi on Tuesday vowed to show the team's best in front of tough opponents.
"We know it's gonna be very hard. We have to face very strong teams from Europe and South America. But it's only when you face someone stronger than you that you can achieve improvement and make it better and better," Lippi said at the pre-tournament press conference.
"There is still a gap between China and the teams like Wales and the Czech Republic. But the gap is getting smaller, as there is a big movement about football being carried out here in China," Lippi added.
Speaking of what they aim to achieve in the tournament, the Italian said that the results are very important and that all the players need to focus on is the game and be prepared for the 2018 Asian Cup.
When asked about Ryan Giggs, the new coach of Wales, Lippi said Ryan Giggs was a great player, and they have known each other since the late 1990s when Juventus met Manchester United in the European Champions League.
He believes Ryan Giggs will be a great coach in the future as he has learned so much from Alex Ferguson.
Feng Xiaoting, China's veteran defender, said that there's always great pressure to play games with strong teams and superstars like Gareth Bale.
But as a defender, he can improve when facing different types of great players in attacking positions. U ruguay and the Czech Republic will also be competing in the tournament.
China will play Wales on March 22. The winner goes into the final directly and the loser enters the third-place playoff.
In the first edition of the tournament last year, China lost 2-0 to Iceland but finished third after beating Croatia in a penalty shootout.
