 "This squad is on the verge of something special and I believe I can lead them to the next level."
Neville and his brother Gary graduated from United's academy as part of the famous 'Class of 92', with both going on to be part of Alex Ferguson's fabled 1999 treble-winning squad.
Since retiring as a player he was part of the coaching staff under David Moyes at both Everton and United as well as with the England Under-21s.
He also holds a UEFA pro coaching license and had some involvement when Gary briefly managed Valencia in 2015-16.
Coaching is very much a family affair, with another Neville sibling, Tracey, the head coach of England's netball team.
Neville's first assignment in his new job will be the SheBelieves Cup tournament in the US in March, when England plays France, Germany and the host. Then comes next year's women's World Cup in France, with England, whose next qualifying game sees it play Wales in Southampton on April 6, looking to improve on its third place at the 2015 edition.
That result was also achieved under Sampson, but the Welshman's reign ended in controversy after he was accused of racism by England striker Eni Aluko, although it was "inappropriate and unacceptable behavior" in a previous role with Bristol Academy that eventually led the FA to fire him.
England Under-19 women's coach Mo Marley took over as caretaker boss of the senior side and helmed the team to a 1-0 friendly loss to France in October before overseeing World Cup qualifying wins over Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kazakhstan.
Attention was then focused on Neville, rather than a female boss, when Chelsea women's manager Emma Hayes ruled herself out of the England job.
