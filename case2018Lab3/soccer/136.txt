RABAT - Morocco on Tuesday launched its campaign for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
During a press conference in the financial capital Casablanca, the bid committee unveiled the official logo of its campaign.
The visual identity of the Morocco 2026 bid reflects the kingdom's national unity and plural identity, said the chairperson of the bid committee Hafid Elalamy.
Elalamy promised a successful World Cup, stressing that if his country wins the honor of staging this event, the edition's legacy will last for long time.
Last August, Morocco submitted their application to host the 2026 World Cup to the world football governing body FIFA, positioning themselves as the sole challenger to the joint submission from Canada, Mexico and the United States.
This is Morocco's fifth bid to host the World Cup, after their unsuccessful bids for the 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010 editions of the tournament.
"This candidacy is different from the precious ones," Elalamy said. "Morocco has gone forward and fulfilled many commitments taken in the previous candidacy, including the building of new stadiums, hotels, infrastructure and transport network."
He highlighted Morocco's bid strength, citing progress made in infrastructure, geographical position, adequate time zone and its population and continent passion for football.
Morocco has picked Vero Communications Ltd, the leading international communications and strategy agency, to promote the North African country's 2026 FIFA World Cup bid. This PR agency worked on Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid and Paris' 2024 Olympics bid.
