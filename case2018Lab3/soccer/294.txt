RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil's Gremio are not thinking about the prospect of playing Real Madrid in the final of this month's FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, according to defender Pedro Geromel.
Copa Libertadores champions Gremio will play the winner of the match between Mexico's Pachuca and Moroccan outfit Wydad Casablanca for the right to play in the final.
In the other semifinal, UEFA Champions League winners Real Madrid will meet either Asian champions Urawa Red Diamonds, Oceania's Auckland City or local club Al-Jazira.
"It doesn't help at all to be thinking about the final if we don't win the semifinal," Geromel said of the clash against Pachuca in Al-Ain on December 12.
"There are many recent examples of teams who were expected to reach the final but didn't. We are only preparing for the semifinal," added Geromel, who was named in the Brazilian Serie A team of the year on Monday.
South American teams have made the final in four of the last seven editions of the FIFA Club World Cup.
This year's decider will be played at the Zayed Sports City stadium in Abu Dhabi on December 16.
