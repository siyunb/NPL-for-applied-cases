 Jose Maria Marin, former president of the Brazilian soccer federation and Juan Angel Napout, former president of the Paraguayan soccer federation and former president of CONMEBOL (South America's soccer governing body). 
In another bizarre event, Chen dismissed a member of the jury for sleeping during hearings. 
A couple of hours earlier, lawyers and Chen had discussed how to dismiss the man without embarrassing him. 
It was decided to do it in the courtroom without any other jurors present. 
"We need the full attention of every juror during these proceedings. I apologize, but we're going to have to let you go," Chen told him. 
Besides journalists, Chen's courtroom has been filled to overflowing with relatives of the defendants and lawyers from companies who have an interest in the case and who take notes continuously. 
Defendants sometimes nibble on sandwiches or salad in the court's cafeteria, often seated in close proximity to lawyers, journalists and court staff doing the same thing. 
Statements from witnesses have generated headlines around the world. A former Argentine government official, Jorge Delhon, killed himself hours after the court was told he took millions in bribes in exchange for handing out television rights. On Thursday his name came up again when a witness gave more details about how he paid the money. 
Eladio Rodriguez, an Argentinian who worked for Burzaco, said that in 2013 he registered a $2.6 million payment to an entity he named "the government".
