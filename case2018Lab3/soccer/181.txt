MADRID -- Real Madrid confirmed on Friday that central defender Sergio Ramos will be out of action for between 2 to 3 weeks after tearing a muscle in his left calf.
The player suffered the injury on Thursday in a training session for the squad members who didn't play in the King's Cup tie away to Numancia, which Real Madrid won 3-0 the same evening with the help of two penalties.
Ramos will at least miss the return leg of the Cup next week, as well as the first leg of the quarter finals the following week assuming Madrid qualify.
He is also certain to miss Sunday's Liga Santander visit to play Celta Vigo and the following weekend's match at home to Villarreal, as well as being a doubt to face Deportivo la Coruna on Jan 20.
Ramos' injury poses an extra problem for coach Zinedine Zidane on Sunday given that full back Dani Carvajal is suspended for the trip to Vigo following his sending off against FC Barcelona on Dec 23.
