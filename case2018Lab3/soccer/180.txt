PARIS -- Ligue 1 outfit Nice on Friday authorized Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder to go to Qatar for medical examination prior to joining Al Gharafa Sports Club.
"Nice allowed Wesley Sneijder to travel to Qatar to pass a pre-deal medical with Al Gharafa Sports Club," read a Nice statement on its official website.
"Once this medical has been successfully completed, the club will accept the player's request to release him from his contractual obligations given the impeccable attitude and professionalism he has shown since he arrived in Nice last August," it added.
Sneijder, 33, once played for Real Madrid and Inter Milan in his career. He joined Nice in August, 2017. He was the Netherlands' most capped player with a total of 133 appearances in the national squad.
He followed the footsteps of Spanish star Xavi Hernandez to feature in the Qatari league, where Al Gharafa sat in mid-table with 11 points from as many matches.
