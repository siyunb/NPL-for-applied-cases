Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez hailed the strength of the squad at his disposal at the China Cup this week.
The South Americans boast superstar strikers Luis Suarez of Barcelona and Edinson Cavani of Paris Saint-Germain among their ranks for the four-nation tournament, which kicks off on Thursday in the southern city of Nanning.
However, Tabarez is particularly pleased with his midfield quota, with Sampdoria pair Lucas Torreira and Gaston Ramirez, Inter Milan's Matias Vecino and Juventus youngster Rodrigo Betancur among his choices in the 23-man squad.
"We expect to have better options than on previous occasions, especially in midfield," Tabarez said.
"We hope to take a team that will give us many options using different players, even if they play in the same position."
Uruguay faces the Czech Republic on Friday, with the winner taking on either China or Wales, who meet in the first semifinal on Thursday.
The tournament will be one of the last chances for Tabarez to size up his options for this summer's World Cup finals, and the 71-year-old is keeping an open mind about who to take to Russia.
"We don't rule out any player," he said. "I have to take players to China who I have a chance of seeing. Those players are a priority, ahead of those who I already know."
Uruguay has been drawn in the World Cup's Group A alongside Egypt, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
