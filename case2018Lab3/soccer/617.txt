BUENOS AIRES - Argentina's national team coach Edgardo Bauza was fired for poor results at the World Cup qualifiers, the country's football association (AFA) said on Monday.
After a defeat to Bolivia last month, Argentina dropped to fifth place in the South American qualifying zone standings -- out of the top-four automatic qualifying positions. To make things worse, Lionel Messi miss the team's three remaining qualifying matches due to suspension.
Argentina have qualified for every World Cup Finals since 1970.
