Brazil under-20 right back Dodo has joined Shakhtar Donetsk from Brazilian Serie A side Coritiba, the Ukrainian champions said on Friday.
Shakhtar reportedly paid two million US dollars to secure the 19-year-old, who had been contracted with Coritiba until next June.
"This is one of the happiest days of my life. A new chapter begins," Dodo, whose real name is Domilson Cordeiro dos Santos, wrote on social media.
He will be the eighth Brazilian in Shakhtar's squad, joining Taison, Fred, Dentinho, Bernard, Alan Patrick, Ismaily and Marcio Azevedo.
Dodo made 54 first-team appearances for Coritiba after being promoted from the club's youth academy in 2016.
Shakhtar currently lead the Ukrainian top flight standings with 13 wins and just two losses from 18 matches.
