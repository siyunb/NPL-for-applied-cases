The Chinese Football Association is remaining tight-lipped on reports that it is considering a ban on players displaying tattoos after members of the national team were apparently asked to cover up their body art during Thursday's 6-0 China Cup loss to Wales in Nanning.
After the game, China Sports Daily reported that the CFA had issued a ban on body art in a bid to improve soccer's image here.
The newspaper also said the CFA regulations would not be restricted to the national team and could affect youth leagues nationwide.
When contacted by China Daily, the CFA denied the report. However, a senior CFA official had earlier told media that it was responsible for creating a healthy soccer culture in China and the improvement of Chinese soccer should be "comprehensive".
The news has sparked heated debate on social media, with those for the ban holding up the tattooless soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo as a shining example to support their argument.
Those against point to his rival, Lionel Messi, whose tattoos have done nothing to diminish the worldwide esteem the Barcelona ace commands.
In 2012, Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo revealed he avoids tattoos because he "donates blood very often." After being newly inked, a person has to wait around four months to donate blood.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo has been a blood and bone marrow donor since he was 24 after being touched by the case of former Portugal teammate Carlos Martins' son, who regularly required transfusions and was in need of a bone marrow transplant after being diagnosed with leukemia at age 3.
Many senior figures in Chinese soccer have long expressed their dislike of tattoos.
