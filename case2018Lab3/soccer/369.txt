 
 West Ham United's new manager David Moyes took aim at some of the club's players with "big reputations" after a 2-0 loss at Watford on Sunday and urged them to live up to their billing. 
 Having fallen behind to Will Hughes' 11th-minute opener, the Hammers missed a host of chances before conceding a second goal in the 64th minute when Richarlison broke clear to score. 
 "I thought it was a big job but there were some players with big reputations who disappointed me a little bit," said Moyes. 
 "Today was the first time I really had the chance to see them play and if that's their reputation, they need to show it." 
 Declaring he did not like what he saw from some of his players, Moyes said he is now fully aware of the task at hand as he seeks to turn around West Ham's Premier League form. 
 "The better team won the game," said the Scot. "We had three big opportunities. We had two in the first half and one in the second. We need things to go our way. It's tough for the players, I can sense that. I didn't enjoy the performance." 
 Hammers fans applauded Moyes before the game but turned their anger and frustration on the club's board and the players - in particular striker Andy Carroll - after another loss that leaves the team in the relegation zone with just nine points. 
 "I am thankful for the support from the fans of me, but we need them now, we need them united," said Moyes. 
 "They have their grievances, they know better than I do about the past."
