MADRID - Valencia on Thursday completed the signing of Atletico Madrid striker, Luciano Vietto in a loan deal which gives them the option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.
Vietto has struggled at Atletico since joining from Villarreal two years ago and also had a loan spell with Sevilla last season scoring 10 goals.
The 24-year-old started this campaign in the Atletico first team squad, but despite some lively performances, he has lacked confidence in front of goal and failed to find the net in 10 appearances this campaign.
The New Year meant that Atletico were able to inscribe both Diego Costa and Vitolo in their first team squad, but also meant that players had to drop out of the squad to clear up places for the new arrivals.
Meanwhile Valencia have lost three out of their last four games as injuries and suspensions stretched their thin squad in December.
Vietto' s move to the club reunites him with coach Marcelino Garcia, who was the boss during his last season at Villarreal, when he scored 20 goals and the forward admitted that Marcelino's presence had been a key factor in his decision.
The local media in Valencia say the club will pay around 2 million euros for the loan deal and a further 10-15 million euros if they decide to make the deal permanent and the striker could make his debut on Saturday when his new side entertain Girona.
