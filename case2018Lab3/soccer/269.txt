BUENOS AIRES - River Plate secured their second consecutive Copa Argentina title by defeating Atletico Tucuman 2-1 in the final here on Saturday.
River forward Ignacio Scocco opened the scoring in the 10th minute before Luis Rodriguez equalized just two minutes later.
Midfielder Ignacio Fernandez struck with an angled drive three minutes after halftime and the Buenos Aires outfit defended resolutely thereafter.
"We haven't been playing well over the last month and a half but we were able to pull through to win a title which is important for this club," midfielder Enzo Perez said.
By winning the competition, River earned the right to play in next year's Copa Libertadores, South America's premier club competition.
