RIO DE JANEIRO - Former Manchester City and Jiangsu Suning striker Jo has agreed to join Japanese club Nagoya Grampus from Corinthians, Brazilian media reported on Friday.
Jo will undergo a medical in Sao Paulo after Corinthians agreed to a 11 million-euro transfer fee, according to the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper.
The 30-year-old Brazilian, who joined Corinthians from Jiangsu Suning in November 2016, enjoyed a prolific 2017 with 25 goals across all competitions.
Earlier this month he won the Bola de Ouro, awarded to the best player in Brazil's Serie A championship.
Nagoya Grampus earned promotion to Japan's top division this year by finishing third in the J2 league.
