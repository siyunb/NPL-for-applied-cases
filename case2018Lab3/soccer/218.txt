KUWAIT -- Oman beat hosts Kuwait 1-0 in the Gulf Cup of Nations on Monday as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia played a goalless draw.
Both matches in Group A were played at the Jaber International Stadium in Kuwait City.
Ahmad Al Mahaijri converted a penalty kick in the 58th minute to hand Oman their first win of the competition and ensure that Kuwait could not qualify for the semi-finals.
In the 67th minute, Kuwait's Faial Al Harbi almost equalized but his header off a free-kick was inches over the crossbar.
The result keeps the hopes alive of Oman, beaten 1-0 by the UAE in their opening match last Friday of reaching the last four.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia, who had beaten Kuwait 2-1 in their first match, were unable to find the net despite a number of chances in the second half.
The last round of games in Group A will be played on Thursday, with Kuwait taking on the UAE and Saudi Arabia facing Oman.
Group B leaders and defending champions Qatar are due to take second-placed Iraq Tuesday. In the other match, bottom-placed Bahrain will meet Yemen.
