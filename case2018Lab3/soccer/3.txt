MONTEVIDEO - Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez admitted on Thursday that the Celeste lack options on the left side of defence as he runs the rule over candidates for his World Cup squad.
A calf injury to Lazio's Martin Caceres meant Tabarez was forced to use Diego Laxalt at left-back during the China Cup in Nanning, played earlier this month.
The Genoa midfielder performed admirably as Uruguay won the exhibition tournament by defeating the Czech Republic and Wales.
However Tabarez said he would be open to other possibilities should Caceres be unavailable during the World Cup in Russia from June 14 to July 15.
"We have a problem on the left side, which got a little worse with the Caceres injury," Tabarez told reporters on Thursday.
"There are full backs in Uruguayan football and abroad playing at a great level but before we bring in new players [to the national squad] we wanted to look inside the squad," he said.
"He [Laxalt] has great physical attributes and a lot of experience. We have asked him to reinforce our defence and the merit is his. He showed he can be considered to play there."
Uruguay have been drawn in Group A for football's biggest tournament alongside Russia, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
