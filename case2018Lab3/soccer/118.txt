LONDON - Manchester City completed the signing of Aymeric Laporte on Tuesday as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang reportedly arrived at Arsenal's training ground to finalize his transfer from Borussia Dortmund.
Premier League leader City is reported to have paid a club record $80 million to Athletic Bilbao for defender Laporte, eclipsing the $78 million it paid for Kevin De Bruyne in 2015.
The 23-year-old is also the second-most expensive defender in history behind Virgil van Dijk, who cost Liverpool $106 million from Southampton earlier this month.
Last week, Alexis Sanchez signed for Manchester United from Arsenal in a swap deal with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and with the clock ticking, it appears Arsene Wenger will land Aubameyang to boost his forward options.
"I am very happy to be here," Laporte said in a statement on Manchester City's website. "City is a club with a lot of ambition and they are one of the best teams in Europe.
"I am looking forward to working under Pep Guardiola and trying to help the club to achieve success."
City boss Guardiola said Laporte was ready to play but might need time to adapt to the Premier League.
"He's fit, he's been playing the last period," Guardiola told reporters. "Of course he has to adapt because the Premier League is special in many senses.
"He is intelligent, he will read what is the situation. Even for English players, when they come into the Premier League it's always a little bit tough. We will be patient because he doesn't come for three months, he comes for five years."
Guardiola has now spent more than $285 million on reinforcing his defense, bringing in Laporte alongside Benjamin Mendy ($74 million), John Stones ($67 million) and Kyle Walker ($64 million).
Guardiola's January spending might not be over after widespread reports that City is interested in Leicester winger Riyad Mahrez.
Mahrez, 26, is reported to have handed in a transfer request as the Algerian tries to force a move to Etihad Stadium.
