RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's Botafogo have appointed former striker Felipe Conceicao as their senior coach for the 2018 season.
The announcement came just hours after the departure of Jair Ventura, who is expected to be named the new coach of Botafogo's Brazilian rivals Santos within days.
It will be Conceicao's first senior management job as he has been a part of Ventura's backroom staff in the past two season.
"I couldn't start my coaching career in a better place," the 38-year-old said in a statement on Botafogo's official website.
"I'm happy, honored and motivated to work. My aim is to utilize the youth academy, which is an asset for Botafogo. We are going to give our young players every chance to develop."
Conceicao started his playing career at Botafogo in 1998 before and had spells with clubs in Germany, Portugal, Spain and China before retiring in 2011.
