"Jiangsu Suning club has officially signs with Fabio Capello today. Capello will manage the club on all matches as the head coach from now on," announced Jiangsu on Sunday.
"It's a consideration on the strategic progress of the club in linking up with Capello, who will bring advanced ideas and methods on club management, coaches training and youth team training program along with steering Jiangsu to built-in agenda," added the club.
Capello brings some familiar faces with him as part of the staff, namely Gianluca Zambrotta and ex-Milan caretaker manager Cristian Brocchi.
The former Real Madrid, AC Milan, Roma and Juventus boss visited the training ground of Jiangsu Suning on Sunday morning and inspected the team's training.
Capello is the third reputable Italian coaching in China following suit of Marcello Lippi and Fabio Cannavaro.
Lippi is already the coach of China national team after successfully steering CSL club Guangzhou Evergrande to three successive domestic league champions and Asian champions once in three years.
Cannavarro is on the bench of Tianjin Quanjian, which had been promoted to the top flight this season, and guides the club to the current sixth place with 19 points, 12 adrift of league pace-setters Guangzhou Evergrande.
Jiangsu were on the lookout for a new boss after South Korea's Choi Yong-Soo resigned from CSL last week.
