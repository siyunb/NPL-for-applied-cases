 
 MILAN - Juventus and Italy goalkeeping great Gianluigi Buffon has slammed the "misuse" of the video assistant referee (VAR), saying it makes Serie A "ugly". 
 The system is being used in Italy's top flight for the first time this season ahead of its World Cup debut in Russia next year. 
 However, mistakes have been made, and Buffon, along with Roma midfielder Diego Perotti, is among its biggest critics. 
 "If you ask me, the VAR is being misused, and out of proportion," Buffon said on Saturday after Juve's 4-2 comeback win at Genoa. 
 "We were told it would be used sparingly, in a fair and logical manner. Instead, it's like we're playing water polo. It's making the game ugly." 
 With Genoa leading 1-0 thanks to Miralem Pjanic's first-minute own goal, Juve went 2-0 down five minutes later thanks to a dubious penalty decision. 
 Match referee Luca Banti failed to spot Genoa striker Andrey Galabinov was offside before he was fouled by defender Daniele Rugani. 
 Juve should have been awarded a freekick, but Galabinov beat Buffon with the resulting penalty. 
 Juve eventually clawed its way back thanks to a Paulo Dybala hat-trick, one of his goals coming from a VAR spot-kick decision following an accidental handball in stoppage time added on for consulting the technology. 
 Roma midfielder Perotti, meanwhile, was livid after not being awarded a penalty after being clearly fouled by Milan Skriniar in Inter Milan's 3-1 win on Saturday. 
 "After this I don't have much faith in VAR," Perotti said. "If we'd scored from the penalty we'd have been 2-0 up and it was game over."
