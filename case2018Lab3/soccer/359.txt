 
 RB Leipzig boosted its chances of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League by thrashing Monaco 4-1 on Tuesday. 
 The German side's four-goal first-half demolition moved it level on points with second-place Porto in Group G. 
 Leipzig took full advantage of slack Monaco defending and Porto drawing 1-1 at Besiktas with a free-flowing attacking display that reignited its knockout hopes. 
 Ralph Hasenhuettl's RB team stays third due its head-to-head record, which has Porto on top, 5-4 over its two matches. Monaco is out of Europe after failing to win once and picking up just two points from its five matches. 
 The Ligue 1 champion needed a win to have any chance of qualifying but gifted Leipzig a sixth-minute lead when defender Jemerson sliced an innocuous Marcel Sabitzer cross past befuddled Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. 
 Jemerson then turned provider for the opposition three minutes later when the Brazilian's weak pass out from the back was intercepted by Kevin Kampl, who scampered forward before feeding Timo Werner with an easy chance that the German slotted home. 
 Monaco briefly rallied, and Radamel Falcao was unlucky to see a close-range stab kicked away by RB stopper Peter Gulacsi. 
 However, Colombian striker Falcao soon had an impact at the other end, clumsily bringing down Willi Orban in his own area and allowing Werner to double his tally from the penalty spot. 
 Leipzig, which sits third in the Bundesliga this term, hosts leader Besiktas on Dec 6 needing to do better than Porto does at home to Monaco.
