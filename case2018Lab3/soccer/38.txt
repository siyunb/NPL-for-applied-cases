MADRID - Leo Messi was once again FC Barcelona's hero as the Liga Santander leaders beat Chelsea 3-0 in the Camp Nou Stadium on Wednesday night to move into the last 8 of the Champions League.
The Barca fans paid homage to Messi with a banner saying 'God Save the King' as the sides took to the pitch and the Argentinean didn't disappoint as he scored two goals and set up another to take Barca into the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the 11th consecutive season.
With Andres Iniesta making a rapid recovery from a hamstring injury, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde included him in the starting 11 along with Ousman Dembele, while Chelsea included Olivier Giroud in a side which included Eden Hazzard, Willian and former Barca midfielder, Cesc Fabrigas.
