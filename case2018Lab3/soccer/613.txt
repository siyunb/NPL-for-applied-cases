 "Certainly, if we get back to our level we can score four goals against anyone."The other first-leg match between Borussia Dortmund and Monaco was called off and rescheduled for Wednesday after three explosions went off near the German team's bus as it set off for the match, injuring defender Marc Bartra.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri again used his daring 4-2-3-1 formation, which has seen his team play some of its best soccer of the season as it utilizes all five of its star attackers.
"We need to be happy with all we have done, but we need to keep our feet on the ground because we still haven't achieved anything," Allegri said. "It's not over, we'll need to play with bravery again ... but we know the weaknesses of Barcelona and also our strengths."Juventus was aggressive from the start and almost scored in the third minute when Gonzalo Higuain's header from a free kick taken by Miralem Pjanic was dropped by Marc-Andre ter Stegen, but the Barcelona goalkeeper recovered in time.
However, the hosts did take the lead four minutes later when Juan Cuadrado pulled a cross back from the right flank for Dybala to curl the ball into the bottom left corner.
