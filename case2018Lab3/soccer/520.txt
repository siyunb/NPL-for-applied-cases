The Portuguese champions had invited the tragedy-hit club from southern Brazil to compete for the annual Eusebio Cup in Lisbon on July 22.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, Chapecoense said it was forced to withdraw from the fixture due to Brazilian Serie A commitments.
Chapecoense are due to play Santos away on July 19 before a home clash against Vitoria four days later.
Seventy-one people died, including 19 Chapecoense players and all of the club's coaching staff, when the chartered plane in which they were travelling crashed into a hillside in Colombia last November.
