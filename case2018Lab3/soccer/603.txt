 Survival. Shakespeare has arrested the freefall of the final weeks under Ranieri, but Leicester is nine points above the relegation zone in 12th place with six games remaining.
"We have given a great account of ourselves (against Atletico)," Morgan said. "Being the last English team getting to the quarterfinals on our Champions League debut is a massive achievement and we can leave the competition with our heads held high."Whether Leicester returns to the competition in the near future appears unlikely. But this is a club that was in the third-tier nine years ago. On the basis of that improbable and rapid climb, little will seem impossible for the years or generations to come at Leicester.
For now, Leicester's players and Thai owners will have to get used to a more mundane reality returning to a club slipping out of the limelight, in the shadows once again of more illustrious English counterparts. The enchanting exploits they produced on the field, will live on.
