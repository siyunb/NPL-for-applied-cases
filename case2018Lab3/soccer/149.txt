 "The Nantes player, Diego Carlos, crashed into me.
"At the time of the collision, I felt a sharp pain where I had recently suffered an injury. My unfortunate reaction was to stick my leg out towards the player."
Chapron and Diego Carlos were racing to catch up with a breakaway by PSG's Kylian Mbappe as the game, which the visitor won 1-0, moved into stoppage time at Stade de la Beaujoire.
The referee appeared to cut across the Brazilian defender and contact was made, sending both to the floor.
