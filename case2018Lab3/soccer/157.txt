Liverpool scored three times within nine minutes on the way to a dramatic 4-3 win over Manchester City on Sunday which ended the Premier League leaders' unbeaten season.
Liverpool struck after less than 10 minutes when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain surged forward from midfield to collect a neat layoff from Roberto Firmino and send a low shot past City keeper Ederson.
Leroy Sane equalized shortly before the break, but Liverpool blew City away after halftime with Firmino chipping Ederson to restore the home side's lead and Sadio Mane striking from the edge of the box.
Egypt international Mohamed Salah looked to have completed the rout when he collected Ederson's clearance and sent the ball sailing back over the stranded keeper's head, but City substitute Bernardo Silva grabbed one back and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan prodded home in stoppage-time.
City's first league defeat in 23 games this season left them still 15 points clear at the top, ahead of Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea.
"Football is unpredictable. Of course you lose today against a fantastic team and you've got to be sure to win the next one and see until the end, fighting to be, until the end, to fight it, to win the Premier League," said City manager Pep Guardiola.
"These kind of things must happen. Now, is analyse, the tactical way, the reason why, and be positive and think, in Newcastle. That is the only thing we can do.
