BERLIN - Hamburg parted company with head coach Markus Gisdol due to poor results, the Bundesliga club confirmed in an official statement on Sunday.
The 48-year-old coach and his assistants Frank Froehling and Frank Kaspari have been relieved from all duties after Hamburg lost 2-0 to last-placed Cologne on Saturday.
"Dismissals ahead of schedule are never wanted but we believe that a new impulse is necessary to maintain our top-flight status," Hamburg's CEO Heribert Bruchhagen said.
The "HSV" had lost all their last four games and sit on the penultimate place of the standings, only three points away from Cologne.
Markus Gisdol took the reins in September 2016 but was never able to lead the "Rothosen" out of the Bundesliga bottom. In 52 competitive matches under Gisdol, Hamburg reaped only 16 wins, 10 ties and 26 defeats.
According to the club's statement, a very timely decision regarding a successor of Gisdol is planned.
The "HSV" have never been relegated since the foundation of the Bundesliga. However, Hamburg were able to escape relegation in the last nick of time in the last years.
