RIO DE JANEIRO -- Flamengo have agreed to sell highly rated striker Felipe Vizeu to Udinese, according to widespread media reports in Brazil.
The Italian club will pay 6.5 million US dollars to secure the 20-year-old on a five-year deal, the Globo newspaper said on Tuesday.
The 20-year-old will fly to Italy to sign a contract this week but is only likely to join Udinese squad in July, it added.
Vizeu, who scored four goals in eight matches for Brazil's under-20 team last year, has netted 17 times in 65 first-team appearances for Flamengo since 2016.
He will join compatriots Danilo and Samir in Udinese's first-team squad.
