Tottenham Hotspur’s First Team players on Friday wore special edition t-shirts celebrating Chinese New Year during training ahead of tomorrow’s North London Derby with Arsenal.
The Club has an estimated fan base of around 45 million in China, with major Official Supporters Clubs in Beijing and Shanghai, engaging daily via its offering of exclusive and bespoke content across its popular and growing social media channels.
To mark the Year of the Dog, the Club, in partnership with Mailman Sports, has today launched 眺旺戊戌年 (Jump Into The Year of the Dog) - a fun and interactive H5 game integrated into the WeChat app.
The aim of the game is to guide Chirpy, Tottenham Hotspur’s popular mascot, from one platform to another by jumping right or left, gaining points for each transition and picking up bonus points on certain platforms.
Fans can scan a special QR code into WeChat to play the game, and the player at the top of the leaderboard at midnight daily will be entitled to a Tottenham Hotspur-related prize, with a signed shirt to be awarded to the winner on New Year’s Day (February 15).
The campaign will end on Lantern Festival (March 2) with the names of the overall top 5 players displayed to a global audience on the LED perimeter boards during Tottenham Hotspur’s Premier League match with Huddersfield Town at Wembley the following day.
In addition, today’s First Team training session was live streamed in China with Club Ambassador and legendary former captain, Ledley King, answering questions from fans during the broadcast.
The Club’s Shanghai Spurs Supporters’ Club will hold a viewing party of the North London Derby, attended by Chirpy, and a range of exclusive content will be released across the Club’s Chinese channels throughout the New Year period.
A successful Year of Cockerel campaign in 2017 gained a total of 6.5 million hashtag views on Weibo - the highest out of all Premier League clubs and the second highest in European football.
