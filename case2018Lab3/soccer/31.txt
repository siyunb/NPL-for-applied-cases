 "Russian is a very difficult language."
Peruvian student Jose Rodriguez Ramos agreed, pointing out the treacherous confusion between new letters and old sounds.
"It's difficult to learn the Cyrillic alphabet," said Ramos, a 28-year-old who was not even born the last time Peru qualified for the World Cup, in 1982.
"First because it is a different alphabet, but also because it's a little similar. You see a P but it's an R and pronounced like an R."
The difficulties are daunting but there are good reasons Morales and his fellow fans are insisting－and they don't all have to do with self-improvement.
"The letters are really weird," he said. "It's not easy. About the only thing I can focus on right now is Messi scoring goals."
