 'You have to score goals,'" Guardiola said.
"Because he has absolutely everything, but sometimes he was thinking more about the pass and now in the last games, at West Ham it was a winning goal and again at Old Trafford.
"He is a star, but now he is enjoying scoring goals. That is so important because we cannot just depend on Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero. We have many options to score and that is so important."
Swansea manager Paul Clement saw his side well beaten, with Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero also on target, but despite his admiration for City, the former Real Madrid assistant coach said his side had contributed to its own downfall.
"To be on the receiving end of that was very difficult," said Clement, whose team remains rooted to the bottom of the standings.
"We knew it was going to be a difficult night, but I would say they are one of the best sides I have ever come across.
"They do the basics, the ugly side of the game. They make it really hard for you. It was a comfortable victory for them.
"I thought we became very passive, showing too much respect - we were not aggressive enough. It was not about putting a striker on to go for it, but just to get upfield.
"It was a tough evening. "They are a really top side."
