 seven leg-amputee players play on each opposing team, and the goalkeepers must have one arm. Crutches are not allowed to touch the ball and there is no offside rule or limits to substitutions.
Forty-two nations now have national amputee soccer federations, according to the World Amputee Football Federation. The next amputee soccer World Cup will be held in Mexico later this year.
