RIO DE JANEIRO - Former Brazil and AC Milan striker Ricardo Oliveira has agreed to join Atletico Mineiro after parting ways with their Brazilian Serie A rivals Santos.
Oliveira will be tied to the Belo Horizonte club until the end of the 2019 pending a medical, Atletico said in a brief statement on Thursday.
The 37-year-old was a free agent after Santos reportedly declined to accept his request for a new two-year deal, offing him a 12-month contract instead.
After joining Santos for a second time in 2015, Oliveira scored 76 goals in 140 matches for the Peixe. He also represented the club in 2003, when he netted 21 times in 32 matches to earn a move to Spanish side Valencia.
He has been capped 16 times for Brazil's national team and scored five goals.
