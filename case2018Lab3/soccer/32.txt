 "Welbeck doesn't feel any contact apart from his own feet connecting with themselves and he goes over." Wenger, though, was reticent about the controversy.
"I haven't seen it again. You want to accuse English players to be divers?" said the Frenchman.
"Was it a penalty? I don't know, the Italian players were not happy. I can understand that, but I don't know what happened.

Milan boss Gennaro Gattuso raged at ref Eriksson at halftime over the dubious spotkick but opted against criticizing Welbeck.
