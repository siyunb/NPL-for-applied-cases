—Arena didn't think much of the Michael Bradley-Jermaine Jones partnership in Panama. "It certainly didn't look like anything special, and as we move forward we continue to look at different possibilities."—He is following 61 players for the June games, could easily cut to 43 and then trim to 31 in anticipation of calling in 25. He doesn't expect new faces not in the pool.
—The roster for the CONCACAF Gold Cup in July depends on the June World Cup qualifiers. "If we're in a desperate situation we may need to go with the team that we think is somewhat the team we're going to play in September. If we come out of these games in good shape, we will have a little bit more flexibility to look at some new players."— Midfielder Christian Pulisic is not likely to play in the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea from May 20-June 11, even though he is on the Americans' 35-man preliminary roster. Pulisic, the top American player in last month's games, likely will be with the national team. Arena said he exchanged texts with Pulisic after the Borussia Dortmund team bus was bombed this week.
—Arena criticized Mexican referee Cesar Ramos for his work during the game in Panama. "I thought the referee did a terrible job," he said. "No one kind of walked away from the game and understood what happened. You have a field that's hard to play on, a little bit bumpy. You have a referee that would not issue cards or call a whole lot fouls, and it was just a rough, scramble of a game."
