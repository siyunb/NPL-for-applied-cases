 'Your husband has picked the wrong team again'," said Van Gaal.
"Same with David Alaba. He made a mistake in the last minute of a game, which led to my dismissal. Now he is one of the biggest talents Bayern has."
Van Gaal also confirmed two legends from his turbulent times at Bayern. He once pulled striker Luca Toni by the ear for slouching during a meal "because it was disrespectful to his teammates and me".
He also hinted that the long-held rumor that he pulled down his underwear in the locker room after at loss at Mainz - to show his squad he "had the balls" to drop them - was true.
"What happened with my players behind closed doors should remain so, but anyone who knows me also knows it could have happened.
"I am emotional," said Van Gaal.
Despite his personality clash with Hoeness, Van Gaal talked of his affection for Bayern.
"Manchester United, the last team I coached, is a commercial club, Bayern are totally different," he said.
"The bosses, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness, are former players who know what they are talking about.
"For them, football is the most important thing, not money, like it is at United. That's why I love FC Bayern."
