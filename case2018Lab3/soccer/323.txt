 
MILAN - Beleaguered AC Milan captain Leonardo Bonucci received the backing of new coach Gennaro Gattuso on Tuesday. 
Bonucci arrived at San Siro during the summer in a surprise $48 million transfer after helping Juventus win six consecutive titles. 
The 30-year-old immediately stepped into the role of captain as the Chinese-owned club pushes for a Champions League return, but Bonucci has had a poor season and Milan sits outside the European places, in seventh. 
That form cost former coach Vincenzo Montella his job. 
"The Milan captain is Leonardo Bonucci and will remain Bonucci," Gattuso said at his first media conference since taking over. 
Despite Milan's stuttering form, Gattuso believes the Italy defender can build the necessary spirit to turn around the team's fortunes. 
"I spoke with a delegation from the team yesterday and I saw guys with great desire to work and make themselves available," said the former Milan defensive midfielder. 
"I asked them for a great sense of togetherness and discipline, and they gave me their full availability. 
"On the pitch I would always look out for a teammate, would have thrown myself in the fire for them. The players have to help each other." 
Milan was one of the biggest spenders last summer, also bringing in Mateo Musacchio, Andre Silva and Nikola Kalinic, but has little to show for the $260 million plowed in by new Chinese owner Li Yonghong. 
"I have clear ideas," said Gattuso. "Montella and I have different methods. I like the team to move forward quickly. 
"Suso. They say he can only play in one role (wing), I want to see if that is true. I also want to see why (Franck) Kessie isn't creating space like last year. 
"Patrick) Cutrone, like Silva, like Kalinic, he's like a tarantula - he never gives up and has great passion. We need more people with that mentality."
