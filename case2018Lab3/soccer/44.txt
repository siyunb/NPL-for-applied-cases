BEIJING - A pair of strikes from Nemanja Gudelj and Alan helped Guangzhou Evergrande beat Jeju United 2-0 in their AFC Champions League group stage tie on Wednesday.
Guangzhou Evergrande broke the deadlock in the 27th minute in spectacular fashion. Alan pulled back for Gudelj after a mazy run in the box, the Serbian unleashed an astonishing right-foot finish that flew into the top corner with both power and precision.
The away team doubled the lead 10 minutes later when Alan steered in a header from close range. It was the Brazilian's fifth consecutive goal in five matches.
Guangzhou Evergrande missed a good chance to extend the cushion eight minutes into the second-half as Gao Lin was sent clear by Ricardo Goulart's back heeled-pass but his low shot was denied by Juju United's goalkeeper LEE Changgeun.
At the other end of the field, Evergrande's goalkeeper Zeng Cheng used his body to block Ryu Seungwoo's attempt.
The hosts almost pulled one goal back in the 63rd minute but Zeng Cheng brilliantly parried away Lee Changmin's free kick.
Jeju United were one player down deep into stoppage time as Kim Wonil was booked for the second time after an awful tackle on Gao Lin.
Guangzhou Evergrande top the group with eight points, three points ahead of second-placed Buriram United.
