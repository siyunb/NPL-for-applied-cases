 "To the extent this report identifies conduct by Qatar 2022 that may not have met the standards set out in the FIFA code of ethics or the bid rules, culpability is mitigated by the fact that these issues were uncovered largely as a result of its cooperation." 
The report said Blatter, who has denied any wrongdoing, bore "some responsibility for a flawed process that engendered deep public scepticism", though it also praised him for implementing reforms including those that made the report itself possible. 
In the running alongside Russia to stage the 2018 World Cup were England and joint bids from Spain/Portugal and the Netherlands/Belgium. Qatar's rivals for the 2022 tournament were Australia, Japan, the United States and South Korea. 
The Swiss attorney general's office used Garcia's report as the basis for a criminal investigation into the award of the tournaments that is still continuing. 
Blatter stepped down in 2015 and was subsequently banned from soccer for six years following an internal ethics investigation.
