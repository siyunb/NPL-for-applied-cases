MAN CITY 3, WEST BROM 1On an almost perfect night for City, popular defender Pablo Zabaleta got a rousing send-off in his last home match. Yaya Toure scored perhaps a farewell goal for the club, and the team virtually guaranteed a place in the Champions League.
Gabriel Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne scored first-half goals, before Toure strolled through West Brom's defense to add the third and bring the home fans at Etihad Stadium to their feet. Toure, who has been at City since 2010, is waiting to discover if he will receive a new contract.
It has already been confirmed that Zabaleta — one of City's most popular players — will be leaving City after nine years, and he came on for the final half hour. Each touch, tackle and foul was applauded and there were tributes, a video montage and a presentation after the game.
ARSENAL 2, SUNDERLAND 0
Alexis Sanchez kept Arsenal's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League alive after scoring twice in the final 18 minutes.
Sanchez, who took his tally for the season to 28 in all competitions, was left unmarked to meet Mesut Ozil's cross and he doubled the lead with a header after Olivier Giroud's volley rebounded out.
Arsenal could still end the season with silverware by beating Chelsea in the FA Cup final, but missing out on the Champions League would be a big blow to Wenger and his chances of both keeping Sanchez and recruiting big-name players.
