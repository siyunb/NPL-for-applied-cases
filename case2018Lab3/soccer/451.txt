MONACO - Cristiano Ronaldo was named UEFA's Player of the Season for 2016-17 on Thursday after a campaign that saw the Portuguese superstar help Real Madrid to the La Liga and Champions League double. 
It marks the third time that Ronaldo has won the award, which was presented on the sidelines of the Champions League group stage draw. 
It could pave the way for him to capture a fifth Ballon d'Or title. 
Ronaldo's greatest rival, Barcelona's Lionel Messi, has twice been named UEFA's Player of the Season. 
"There are the same goals, every year, to meet the same challenges, win everything if possible, qualify for the World Cup with my national team," said Ronaldo. 
"This trophy will give me the motivation to keep working hard, never to give up. I am blessed and delighted to be with Real Madrid." 
Ronaldo won the UEFA award in 2013-14 and 2015-16. 
In the Champions League last season, where Real defeated Juventus 4-1 in the final, he finished as top scorer with 12 goals. 
Juventus goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon was second in the voting, while Messi finished third.
