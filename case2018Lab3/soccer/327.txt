 "SIPG's performance is just too poor. 
"Even if SIPG has renewed Villas-Boas' contract, they should cancel it. Why did they paid that much money for him?" 
Currently, 12 out of 16 CSL clubs are managed by foreign coaches, with Italy World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro leading Evergrande's title defense next term after recently succeeding Brazilian Scolari. 
Another high-profile Italian, Fabio Capello, is in charge at Jiangsu Suning, while Germany is represented by a trio of bosses - Roger Schmidt (Beijing Guo'an), Felix Magath (Shandong Luneng Taishan) and Uli Stielike (Tianjin Teda). 
Spaniard Gregorio Manzano (Guizhou), Portugal's Paulo Sousa (Tianjin Quanjian), Chilean Manuel Pellegrini (Hebei China Fortune), Serbian Dragan Stojkovic (Guangzhou R&F) and South Korean pair Chang Woe-ryong (Chongqing Lifan) and Park Tae-ha (Yanbian Fude) complete the league's foreign coaching contingent.
