RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil legend Kaka has announced his retirement from football at the age of 35.
The former AC Milan and Real Madrid midfielder revealed his decision on social media, more than two months after playing his last match for Orlando City.
"It was much more than I could have ever imagined," Kaka wrote. "Thank you! I'm now ready for the next journey."
Capped 95 times for his country, Kaka was a part of the Brazil squad that won the 2002 World Cup and was voted the FIFA world player of the year in 2007.
He began his career at Sao Paulo in 2001, but it was at AC Milan - whom he joined in 2003 - where he left his greatest mark.
In a glittering six-year spell, he led the Italian club to the 2003-04 Scudetto, the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana, the 2007 UEFA Super Cup, the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2006-07 Champions League title.
Kaka moved to Real Madrid in 2009 for 67 million euros, and although he never quite reached the heights of his Milan years, he helped the Spanish club to the 2010-11 Copa del Rey and the 2011-12 La Liga title.
The playmaker returned to Milan for the 2013-14 season and enjoyed a successful five-month loan spell with Sao Paulo before finishing his career at Orlando city.
