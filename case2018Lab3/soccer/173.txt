PARIS－Sprint legend Usain Bolt said on Sunday he still hopes to see his dream of becoming a professional soccer player come true with a tryout for German top-flight club Borussia Dortmund.
However, the multiple Olympic and world champion said he would prefer to play for Manchester United, his favorite team.
"In March we're going to do a trial with Dortmund and that will determine what I do with that career, which way it goes," the 31-year-old 100 and 200-meter world-record holder told the Sunday Express.
"If they say I'm good enough, and that I need a bit of training, I'll do it.
"It makes me nervous. I don't get nervous, but this is different. It'll take time to adjust but once I play a few times I'll get used to it."
Bolt shares the same sponsor－Puma－as Dortmund and the trial with the Bundesliga team has been arranged by the sportswear company.
"One of my biggest dreams is to sign for Manchester United," said Bolt.
"If Dortmund says I'm good enough, I'll really train hard.
"I've spoken to (former United manager) Alex Ferguson and I told him he needs to put in a good word for me.
"He said that if I get fit and ready, he will see what he can do."
