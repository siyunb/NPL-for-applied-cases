LONDONÔºçTottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino on Thursday played down talk of a rift between himself and fullback Danny Rose after the England international was left out of last week's north London derby against Arsenal.
Asked to comment on reports that Rose was "fuming" about his omission from the squad, Pochettino said the 27-year-old, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, had not been happy but had accepted the decision.
"He never showed that feeling to me," Pochettino said. "The day before we had a conversation and he never showed me that he was angry. Of course, disappointed, yes, because all the players always want to be involved.
"I understand if after he was angry, like other players who do not play, and I like it when players feel that emotion because it looks like they're interested in helping the team and want to play."
Pochettino, whose side responded to the Arsenal defeat in style by winning 2-1 at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday to top its Champions League group above Real Madrid, stressed that it was not just Rose who missed out.
"He was normal, his behavior. You can ask me about him or (Georges-Kevin) Nkoudou, who wasn't involved, or Paulo Gazzaniga or Kieran Trippier or Ben Davies. If you say they were upset? Of course. They were disappointed? Of course.
"But I am the boss. That is the problem for the players."
Rose, who recently recovered from a long-term knee injury, returned for the win in Dortmund and will be in contention for Saturday's home clash against West Bromwich Albion when fourth-place Spurs will hope to make up some lost ground on leader Manchester City.
Tottenham, third and second under Pochettino in the last two seasons, are 11 points behind City, three points adrift of Manchester United and two back from Chelsea.
