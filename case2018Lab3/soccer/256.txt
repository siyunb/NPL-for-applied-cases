 "To celebrate with your fans is part of it. In Germany, everyone goes over (to the fans) if you win or lose. I said when I arrived that winning or losing, you have to go over when you are away to say 'thank you'.
"The last action was in the corner (in front of the City's fans) and we celebrated there in a normal way - nothing exceptional."
'No respect' 
United hosted Bournemouth on Wednesday night as it began the task of trying to chip away at City's huge 11-point lead in the Premier League.
Speaking to reporters at United's Carrington training ground on Tuesday, Mourinho became visibly agitated by repeated questioning about the City brawl.
At the end of the briefing, as he left the room, he berated journalists for not asking him more questions about Bournemouth.
"You don't like Bournemouth, hey?" he asked.
"You don't respect them? You don't think they are a team capable of coming to Old Trafford and doing well? No respect for (Bournemouth manager) Eddie Howe? No respect for the players?"
