 "Throughout my career I've had the chance to work with many talented 17- and 18-year-olds, but unfortunately some of them got lost after they made it to the first team.
"As a team manager, you have to check the communication. Sometimes the communication is wrong and we must nowadays consider the impact of the social-media age on these youngsters."
Capello also urged clubs "to communicate with the families of young players". "This is sometimes forgotten," he added.
Capello cited compatriot Mario Balotelli as an example of a wasted talent.
At 27, the former Inter Milan, Manchester City and Liverpool striker now finds himself plying his trade for perennial French Ligue 1 midtablers Nice after being dogged by disciplinary problems throughout his career.
"Balotelli had immense potential, but then he got lost," said Capello.
"I often hear from young players that they have bad luck, but there is no such thing. There is hard work day by day, and there is no success without sacrifice.
"I always tell players to go beyond the daily challenges and challenge yourself."
