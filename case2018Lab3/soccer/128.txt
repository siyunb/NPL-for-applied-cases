MADRID - FC Barcelona on Saturday confirmed that central defender Gerard Pique will sign a new contract on Monday which will keep him at the club until the end of June 2022.
Pique's new contract will have a buyout clause of 500 million euros and he will sign it at a ceremony in the Camp Nou Stadium.
The central defender will therefore remain with Barcelona until the end of his playing career and has commented on his desire to perhaps one day be president of the club.
Meanwhile, Espanyol have presented an official complaint about Pique and Sergio Busquets after comments the pair made following Barca's cup triumph over their neighbors on Thursday.
Pique talked about 'Espanyol de Cornella' which can be perhaps seen as mocking a club which has its ground in the Cornella district of Barcelona, but which was founded with the name 'Espanyol de Barcelona.'
Meanwhile Busquets criticized Espanyol's celebrations after their 1-0 first leg, saying, "It seemed they have won the tie when it lasts 180 minutes."
