 "Roma made the most of a single moment. Dzeko was a key player, but apart from his goal they didn't have a chance, we had possession.
"If we had finished off the chances we had in the first leg the match would have been over."
Roma held on, and after Italy's stunning failure to qualify for the World Cup, its progress to the last eight along with Juventus is a boost for the country.
There have not been two Italian clubs in the quarterfinals of the Champions League since 2006-07, when Roma joined eventual winner AC Milan in the last eight.
There will also be at least three Italian coaches in the quarterfinals - Di Francesco, Massimiliano Allegri of Juventus and Vincenzo Montella of Sevilla.
"I spoke with Montella a few days ago and we said we'd meet in the final," said Di Francesco.
Antonio Conte could make it four Italian coaches in the quarters if Chelsea manages to knock off Barcelona on Wednesday.
