MADRID - Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said on Wednesday that he had no wishes for 2018 other than good health and happiness and that he had not asked the club for any new players in the January transfer window.
Speaking ahead of Thursday's King's Cup game away to second tier side Numancia, it was Zidane's first press conference in Spain since his side were thrashed 3-0 at home to Barcelona on December 23rd to leave them 14 points off the top of the Liga Santander table.
Zidane came in for serious criticism after that defeat, but said he was optimistic about 2018.
"We are in three competitions and we have the same excitement and we will do everything to give the maximum in every game. We return to the Cup and hope to continue into the next round," he said.
Madrid have struggled to score goals this season, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema netting just six between them in the league, but Zidane doesn't see the need for new faces.
"It's true that the defeat in the Classico ... but we have the same hopes and we will compete in every competition. Later, at the end of the season, we will see if there are things we have to change," he said.
The Madrid coach admitted meeting club President Florentino Perez to discuss possible signings.
"We spoke about everything and also about reinforcements. Today, there will be no signings, but until Jan 31st, anything can happen," he commented, adding that what he didn' t want was "for any player to leave the squad."
Zidane also explained that French striker Karim Benzema was suffering from an injury he picked up in the defeat to Barcelona and refused to discuss possible moves to sign Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, who is widely tipped to be a winter signing for the club.
