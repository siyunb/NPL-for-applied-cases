RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazilian Serie A champions Corinthians have reached an agreement to sign former Brazil international defender Henrique, just days after the 31-year-old parted ways with rivals Fluminense.
Henrique is among eight players released by Fluminense in the past week as the four-time Brazilian top-flight champions seek to ease their wage bill.
Corinthians are awaiting confirmation that Henrique is a free agent before making the announcement official, according to the club's football manager Alessandro Nunes.
"We have a deal in place but he must rescind his contract with Fluminense first," Nunes told Globo Esporte.
Henrique, a center-back who has made seven appearances for Brazil's national team, spent two seasons with Fluminense after his 2015 move from Napoli.
