RIO DE JANEIRO - FIFA has handed lifetime bans to the former presidents of the Venezuelan, Nicaraguan and Guam football associations for fraud.
The world football governing body's ethics committee barred Venezuela's Rafael Esquivel, Nicaragua's Julio Rocha and Guam's Richard Lai from participating in all football-related activities.
Esquivel and Rocha pleaded guilty in 2015 to accepting bribes for broadcasting and marketing rights. In April, Lai pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy in connection with kickback schemes to support AFC and FIFA elections.
Esquivel is also a former vice-president of South American football confederation CONMEBOL while Rocha is a one-time FIFA development officer.
Lai's resume includes spells as a FIFA committee member and an Asian Football Confederation official.
