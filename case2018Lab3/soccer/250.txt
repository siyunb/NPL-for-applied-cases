In China's central metropolis of Wuhan one free-spirited Spaniard is doing his bit for the nation's soccer push in his own inimitable way.
Sergio Ledesma Vera's CV speaks for itself - he has previously worked as a coach at Barcelona, as a competition judge and as a sports facility manager, and in 2009 graduated with a Masters degree in sports psychology.
However, perhaps most important of all is his infectious enthusiasm and energy.
"In Spain, children begin to play football when they are three or four years old. Without utilitarian goals, they are really interested. The sport is indispensable to their daily life," said the 36-year-old.
"Now I am teaching 20 children. They are talented young players selected from schools across Wuhan.
"Most of them are eight to 15 years old. They go to school in the day and after come to play football. I am looking forward to see how they develop.
"I came here in 2014 to stimulate Chinese children's interest in and talent for soccer."
Three years later, Sergio only speaks basic Chinese but insists the language barrier is but a minor hindrance.
"Soccer is the common language shared by us. I use chess pieces to illustrate game strategy and tactics and they can easily understand what I want to express," he said.
Watching Sergio at work is an impressive sight.
"In the fast transition from offense to defense, as a yellow team member, if you are encircled by your opponents, what should you do?" he asked the children, who immediately raised their hands to answer.
Kids are then encouraged to put their theoretical education into practice on the pitch. After formulating training schedules with Chinese coaches in the morning, Sergio takes part in matches with his pupils in the afternoon.
"Playing in a match can help them gain experience and make progress," he enthused.
"They have great potential and will be future stars."
