BERLIN - Hamburg have appointed Bernd Hollerbach as their new head coach, the struggling Bundesliga club confirmed in an official statement on Monday.
One day after the dismissal of Markus Gisdol, Hamburg have completed the deal with former Hamburg player and Felix Magath assistant Bernd Hollerbach, who has penned a contract until June 2019.
The 38-year-old coach led the first trainings session on Monday afternoon before he was officially introduced.
"Bernd Hollerbach has managed, despite modest means, to promote with Wuerzburg twice. He has the right mix of authority and warmth," Hamburg's sporting director Jens Todt said.
Hollerbach played from 1996 until 2004 for the "HSV" and marked four goals in overall 197 appearances. After his spell at Hamburg, he hung up his boots and opted for a job as a coach.
"My goal is to act with my team on the pitch and not just react. It is important to stage a well-positioned defence and to make sure that the opponents can't score easy goals. We will do everything to keep the top flight status," Hollerbach said.
The former defender was Felix Magath' s assistant at Wolfsburg (2007-2009) and Schalke (2009-2011) before he took the helm as a head coach at Wurzburger Kickers in 2014.
He was in charge for three years at his hometown club and led the Wuerzburger Kickers from the fourth to the second division. Hollerbach was however sacked after the club relegated into the third division.
Hamburg sit currently on the 17th position after suffering four consecutive defeats. They encounter fourth placed Leipzig on Saturday. Enditem
