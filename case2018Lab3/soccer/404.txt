 "I am home".
Gunnarsson has no doubt that the World Cup is where Iceland, ranked 22nd in last month's world rankings, belong.
"Nonsense? I don't know if this is nonsense," he said. "After we lost against Croatia (in the 2014 World Cup playoffs) we aimed at qualifying next time. In my opinion we were in the most difficult group, but we decided that we were just going to finish this. We had no interest in some playoff bother."
Inside the bar, the rambunctious crowd, wearing their red, white and blue jerseys, bounced around. Even the tourists appeared to get caught up in the excitement.
"Not since 1996, when Tony Adams played for Arsenal, have I followed football, but last summer that all changed," said Arni thor Arnason, with a beer in his hand. "Now we're going to the World Cup, unreal. I still don't believe it."
Reykjavík's bars usually close at 1am on weekdays but Monday's celebrations seemed set to continue until dawn. There will be some sore heads on Tuesday but come the start of the World Cup the whole country will likely be at a standstill.
