European soccer giant AFC Ajax signed a cooperation agreement with the Chinese Super League club Guangzhou R&F on Monday, aiming to help improve youth training, along with Chinaâ€™s growing efforts to boost its soccer industry.
According to the agreement, seven technical coaches from Ajax will be sent to Guangzhou R&F's training base in Meizhou, Guangdong province, in January.
"China's growing investment in soccer has impressed us very much. The cooperation will be very important to bringing Ajax's training philosophy to Chinese young players," said Edwin van der Sar, CEO of AFC Ajax.
The training project is Ajax's first outside Europe.
