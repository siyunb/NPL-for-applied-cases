 
HONG KONG - Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho has denied speculation linking him to a move away from the Chinese Super League after his recent impressive performances for Brazil and Guangzhou Evergrande. 
The 28-year-old, who joined Evergrande from Spurs in June 2015, signed an extension to his initial contract in January. 
But after scoring a hat-trick in Brazil's 4-1 World Cup qualifying win over Uruguay last month, Paulinho appears to be in high demand. 
"These transfer rumors are normal in the soccer industry," he told Chinese media this week. "My agent must have received inquiries from some European clubs. 
"But I like where I am and I have been having a good time with my teammates and coaches. I'd like to stay here to win more titles with Evergrande." 
Paulinho joined Evergrande for $14.9 million after an indifferent spell in north London and has impressed since. 
The former Corinthians star helped Evergrande win the 2015 Asian Champions League and has also picked up two Super League winner's medals. 
Guangzhou also moved to squash the rumors. 
"Hereby we officially announce that Guangzhou Evergrande has never received an offer for Paulinho," the club said in a statement. 
"Paulinho signed a contract extension with Guangzhou Evergrande in January 2017 and he is a key player in the club's long-term plan."
