RIO DE JANEIRO -- Barcelona have exercised an option to secure Brazilian central defender Marlon on a permanent deal, the Spanish club said on Wednesday.
The 21-year-old, who joined Barcelona on loan from Fluminense last July, will be tied to the Blaugrana for the next three seasons, according to a statement on the Catalan club's website.
Marlon made 24 appearances for the Barcelona B team last season and was called up by first-team manager Luis Enrique for the Champions League clash with Celtic in November.
He also featured in the last two La Liga matches of the season, filling in for Gerard Pique and playing the full 90 minutes against Las Palmas and Eibar.
