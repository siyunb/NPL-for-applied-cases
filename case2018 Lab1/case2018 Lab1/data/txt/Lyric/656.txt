If it's getting harder to face everydayDon't let it showDon't let it showThough it's getting harder to take what they sayJust let it goAnd if it hurts when they mention my nameSay you don't know meAnd if it helps when they Say I'm to blameSay you don't own meEven if it's talking the easy way outKeep it inside of youDon't give inDon't tell them anythingDon't let itDon't let it showEven though you know it's the wrong thing to saySay you don't careSay you don't careEven if you want to believe there's awayI won't be thereI won't be thereBut if you smile when they mention my nameThey'll never know youAnd if you laugh when they say I'm to blameThey'll never own youEven if you feel you've got nothing to hideKeep it inside of youDon't give inDon't tell them anythingDon't let itDon't let it show展开
